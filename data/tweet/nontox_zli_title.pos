lol only trophies overall . the best spanish defender is piqué with trophies and playing a big part in each yeah okay , he sat behind puyol for most of his career and ramos was paired with puyol in wc for spain not pique . . still ramos > pique let ' s be real , ramos and puyol did most of the defending cleaning up piques blunders . but yeah ramos > let ' s be real ? ok . since puyol left barça , barça have won titles in years stop with your bull shit . you can even go ahead and see puyols answer when asked who is the best center back . he answers its pique pique is the spanish defender with most trophies . so just stfu . he is less exposed than ramos and at least ramos doesn ' t cry to twitter whenever barca wins a game against france , pique was their best defender

pure awesomeness . … just in : moments ago president trump greeted white house guests as he reopens the white house to public tours . yeah , it was so awesome when sexual predator trump 🍊 💩 🤡 🐷 🤥 grabbed women by the pussy . give it a rest fake christian awesome , so he ' s a man . your point ? men don ' t grab women by their pussies without consent . that ' s sexual assault . the fact you don ' t know that is frightening . 🚫 🤚 🙀 only liberals could turn a statement into sexual assault . that ' s frightening . & only a liberal would post that incorrect img image is a direct quote of exactly what he said : " i don ' t even wait " he said he does it ! what ' s wrong w / image if trump said it ? the image states the president said it . that is incorrect as he was not the president and how many years ago was it again ? 🤔 it ' s like quoting obama from his book that was published before he was president . you ' re working hard to accept your choice .

yes , we are in a world in which killing unborn babies is not a crime in usa states have exemptions in child abuse statues for religious reasons , shouldn ' t you focus on that first we need to focus on the things that matter . killing , abusing , torturing is all wrong , period how about taking away autonomy from people you disagree with ? that seems important to some people how about taking lives from unborn people who cannot disagree because they do not have the chance ? seems important to 😉 because the lives of the actual living person and what they need are more important what you are trying to say sounds dangerous , an unborn human being is actually alive , not less important . . . take care 🙂 so then a unborn is more important then the person it is in both are human beings , both matter . . . why one human being deserves life and the other don ' t ? 😊 do you believe everyone should be required to give blood , bone marrow and donate organs ?

it ' s correct . china ( ) did a lot more than global integration ; ( ) wto accession was ; ( ) trading more isn ' t nl chinese reform shouldn ' t give comfort to anyone on the left . doesn ' t mean it is ' neoliberal ' i don ' t know what you mean by ' neoliberal ' then . is it thatcherism or global trade ? both of those ? i think the " index of economic freedom " is crap but let ' s say it ' s valid . china ' s at . hong kong at . movement from to ain ' t neoliberal . movement from to is reasonable to call neoliberal . marginal . ok , i disagree about terms . " neoliberal era " was when many countries moved in a markedly pro - market direction most latin american countries are not neoliberal but made neoliberal moves during this period , eg . nrly all wd applaud if n . kor allowed small markets for produce from small garden plots . you wd call that ' neoliberal ' maybe not , but if nk adopted eu trade rules , yes . think this is a much more interesting point by you … rest is just arguing about a word there ' s a global secular trend of improvement in human development ; propagandistic to ascribe it to any policy regime

calling your wife " mother " isn ' t christian culture . it ' s just old midwestern culture . it ' s weird , but also a sign of good casserole nearby . i find that a million times less weird than his " i can ' t ever be alone with a woman or drunk near a woman or i might fuck her " stance . the main reason for doing this is to remove the chance of the appearance / accusation of impropriety ( cough . . casada ) the way to remove the appearance of impropriety is to not rub your hand on a woman ' s leg in a bar . simple dinner is fine . if i was supposed to sleep with every man i ' ve ever been alone with or had dinner with , i have failed as a woman . in fairness , you haven ' t had dinner with mike pence . ( at least as far as i know . )

twitter ' s update is basically twitter shitting in its left hand and then smacking itself hard in the face . but , if you look past the shit pyrotechnics , you can kind of see what they are utterly failing at achieving . they are attempting to force quote - rt ' s to be official public - facing conversations and , for some utterly fucked reason , attempting to turn normal replies into slack channels . you can kind of see what they were aiming for with group dm ' s: a drunken , ad hoc attempt at recreating irc . they clearly envision you , friends , and nazis having a jolly ol fireside chat in your replies .
interesting to attend launch of being held tonight . boost torbay now that is a good idea .
i need someone to take a sharp object and poke it into my eye . it ' s gotta be better than dealing with this nonsense .
provided no one is harmed by these rules . i understand that human nature will often put a salacious spin on m / f work dinners / meetings / travel in the form of gossip & inuendo , i have been the object of such speculation w / a work colleague , because folks didn ' t believe m / f could be friends w / out a sexual component . my husband & i have a supportive , trusting relationship & when i told him about the gossip , he laughed . this may be partly due to his high confidence level , & about the trust we have for each other . so i get it , mr & mrs pence . a politician has to maintain a very circumspect aura around them . ( i ' ve worked for a male politician ) but i still can ' t wrap my head around the fact that this personal code of conduct feels very exclusionary & condescending , to both men & women . like a human needs a chaperone to guard their it ' s a kind of ostentatious virtue . obsession with sexual morality above other kinds . and sees women mainly as sex objects . yeah . i ' m actually quite for the " avoid problematic situations " idea . i think i may have learned it from dan savage . but the suggestion that a woman and man dining together is *always* problematic is pretty effed up . yes , exactly . it doesn ' t admit the possibility of a friendship / business relationship that isn ' t a threat somehow .

i stopped going to church for a series of reasons . i consider myself spiritual but not really religious . i couldn ' t fake it sitting there knowing i was wrong i realized churches are all about money man . . there ' s always an exception to this but that ' s my opinion most churches are open maybe one week day and then of course sunday . . but why ? why are church doors so limited . churches are to spread the word to the people . for the communities . why aren ' t they opening their doors and doubling as daycares or shelters

english has a bit of that as well : the inflection in sing / sang / sung , and the derivation in rise / raise , lie / lay , sit / set , full / fill . difference is , in english it ' s not productive . new words aren ' t formed based on these alternations . in semitic languages , not only are these processes productive , but also there ' s a much richer system of vowel changes . a semitic root has consonants . a few have , but these inflect as if they had - the middle consonants act like indivisible unit . standard example in both hebrew and arabic : ktb , " writing . " hebrew has : katav = he wrote ktiva = writing ktovet = address michtav = letter ( don ' t worry about b vs . v or k vs . ch - in hebrew those are regular alternations ) . arabic has , kitāb = book kutub = books maktaba = library now , i want to focus on verbs and not nouns , since they have a richer inflection system and more systematic hebrew / arabic correspondence . verbs inflect for tense ( past vs . present in arabic , past vs . present vs . future in hebrew ) and person , as in spanish or russian . those inflections are fairly regular , but there are special side rules based on the root consonants . in both hebrew and arabic , a y or w ( v in hebrew ) in 2 nd place tends to be suppressed . hebrew has more special rules , but fewer verb forms .

on the other hand , leuer to the starting lineup hasn ' t worked nearly as well as hoped . drummond on / leuer on yields a reb % of just . drummond on , leuer on yields a defensive rating . only two teams have a worse defensive rating this season than that mark . mind you , with harris the pistons had a d - rating . some of that can be chalked up to the def disaster that ad and rj have been together . the pistons have entered a new era with the benching and likely shutting down of reggie jackson . nobody should benefit more than harris . without jackson , harris has flourished . he has the second - highest usage on the team at ( team leading since ) harris scores points per possession since without rj , and he ' s scoring points per shot attempt . additionally harris has been the pistons most efficient scorer in almost every offensive play - type . regard , if you will , examples as follow : tobias harris has been the pistons most efficient pick and roll ball handler , followed by reggie jackson and kcp . tobias harris has been the most efficient spot - up shooter among all rotational players tobias harris is perhaps the biggest reason the pistons are lethal in transition , when their personnel ( ie drummond / jackson ) allow

if you call fruit vegan i stg i mean bees are animals , and don ' t bees have to pollinate the fruit plants yeah but they pollinate plants naturally , not because humans force them to do so they naturally lay eggs because that ' s how they reproduce 🙃 🙃 🙃 🙃 🌸

wait , you didn ’ t know that conservative evangelicals think of women as second class humans ? who shouldn ’ t be out in society as full equals . of course pence doesn ’ t spend any time with women who aren ’ t his wife . this is news ? oh gosh . right . i ’ m so sorry to tell you … a zillion of these “ christians ” think this way . and they ’ ve been strategizing about how to take over government for years . for god . they believe women should obey men . men know what god says . there are huge debates about whether women should ever be leaders of anything . they fear spending time with people who don ’ t share their religious beliefs . pastors tell everyone what god wants . people listen . they rewrote all the curriculum in our schools . they ally with major corporations . and now they control everything . be freaked out about this pence thing . but wow , that ’ s the tip of a giant christian evangelical iceberg that i guess you haven ’ t seen . it ’ s not a joke . these folks literally want to return to a time when men were in charge . women stayed home . and white people dominated all . bible studies preaching that women should always stay married , even if the man is beating her . that ' s god ' s will . she ' ll grow in his love . very chilling stuff . they are trained in how to respond to every argument promoting tolerance against their version of reality .

of which the eu decided what it ' s spent on . and of time it ' s not of required things like housing and infrastructure . actually we in the uk and the regions decide what the structural funds are spent on . . . barnsley wanted to build housing the eu told them they had to build a bypass nonsense there an idea why don ' t we cut london funding and start a mass building in the rest of the uk . ? what london funding ? or come on . london gets more spent on it than anywhere else in the uk . i ' d wager it gets less per person than most other areas in it was more per head . and that was guardian saying that . spent by the government ?

if u can prove he has consistently promoted men over women , that ' s an issue . otherwise , it ' s not . and his marriage rules r not your business they are of they affect my ability to do my job , regardless of promotions . so , you think this is really an big issue . what % of the female population do you this this affects . let ' s have another law , more gov ' tment . . its already a law . . any woman with a career could be discriminated against based on vps marriage choices bc other dudes do it too and even if it only affected a small amt of women , it would still be wrong already stated it was unfair . the point is it ' s not illegal or actionable unless you prove it did actual harm . then do what the law allows . he ' s openly admitting that he discriminates against women in the workplace . just bc nobody has sued him doesn ' t make it legal where is the law that a boss must have dinner alone with his female employee if he has dinner with a male . cause , i don ' t think it exists . if he has dinners with male staff that involve work , but not females , its sex discrimination for which every state has laws abt . every corporate hr has rules against this crap bc it is discriminatory and w / o those rules they open themselves up to lawsuits .

if trump and pence really cared about women ' s rights & empowerment , they would respect and support a woman ' s right to choose . don ' t like trump or pence , but abortion is not a right and definitely doesn ' t empower . pro life i ' ve marched for life with thousands of women in washington dc and pray with them every week . how many babies have you adopted ? how often do you feed children who are hungry ? how often do you care for sick children ? i have not adopted but kept my oldest child , born out of sexual assault . he is an awesome , giving man now and loved by many .

japan has welfare , univ govt healthcare insurance , social security , public schools , state universities . etc . they ' re democratic - socialist . it depends on ur definition , i . e . where on the spectrum between socialism & capitalism , you consider democratic - socialism to start & end . i ' m going by common usage . most republicans agree eu countries are democratic - socialist . calling them " mixed " doesn ' t say what the mix is . there are extremists on both sides . on the right you have the kkk , right - wing militias , neocons , christian extremists , etc . i ' m not going to judge an economic system successful all over the world based on the protest tactics of the far left in the us . that ' s silly

i bet they just wanted to sound edgy in the beginning . but then they kept skirting the line until they ended up crossing it altogether . but how you go from liking stuff like abo and similar kinks to wanting to fuck real animals is kind of beyond me . . . someone in the thread linked it to the art style and compared it to the south park fandom , which i can kind of see . i ' m just aware of its reputation . i fortunately got into it after it settled . if i want more wank , i ' m sure i could find it . . .

i mostly leveled up on dragonblight , which was a good choice . no ganks . i raided a bit with some shitty raiding guilds , but they were nice there was one called circadium paradigm , no one knew what it meant or why it was called that , but i loved the people in it , especially pj idk how i got into the guild before i was level capped , but they trusted me to do well . pj was my shaman mentor . like , for real . a mentor . i quickly outgrew the guild though , and they broke up soon after i left , which was a precedent for me apparently . if i left a guild , it was almost always hearing its death knell soon after . i had a sixth sense for it without knowing how . so i joined triarii , which i had but we had no backfill because our recruitment was nads , so obviously it crashed as soon as a few core members stopped logging on . a bit after i left , i got an offer to join a top guild on bdf , and so did my friend , who was the top server holy priest . so we transferred . that guild was full of mean people and it sucked so i left the fuck outta that . i couldn ' t find a guild i wanted to tie myself to afterward . that ' s when i became very well known on the server . another friend of mine on db inspired this idea , and i became like a freelance raider no guild , but i was on any respectable raid leader ' s shortlist for dps to fill a spot in their 1 0 s / 2 5 s . they knew i could pull my weight .
really ? ceo himself said because of trump a ceo making sycophantic suck up comments doesn ' t negate actual objective reality . happened under trump a ) it didn ' t . you ' re just wrong . b ) adding jobs at three plants isn ' t really " three new plants , " regardless . oh ! so you saying it ' s another shitty obama deal ? ? ? you dumbocrats are really something else lol i ' m happy you explain the jobs that obama created ! so the idiot manchild you worship was caught beating his chest over jobs he didn ' t even create and you ' ve somehow made it a knock on obama ? " manchild " very original - - yeah obama is a narcissistic , anti - american brat holy goddamn shit , " narcissistic " ? a trumpkin using that pejoratively ? i didn ' t think it was even possible to have so little self - awareness . ooooh " pejoratively " ! you need a pocket dictionary to impress ? self - aware ? ? not making sense . and yes his is !
amazing that as white supremacists take state power , liberals & maga frog men find common ground in shared fantasies of " free speech . " not even the berkeley free speech movement was grounded in abstract speech , but a call to " put your bodies upon the gears " of power . and everyone usually forgets that that movement on the uc berkeley campus began as a part of the civil rights movement . it was part of a highly disruptive political power struggle and not some calm debate in a lecture hall or seminar room . over time " speech " became an end in itself - - completely detached from any broader social movement .

yes of course just sick of all the whinging by the remain you really think if we had voted to stay there would have been so much moaning ? again , this is about how the process works ( with parliament ' s approval ) and not about what the process is about ( leaving eu ) you ' re letting your leaveeu dogma get in the way of why you thought you wanted to leave . that ' s not taking back control , it ' s handing it over no its not its control by the majority party in our parliament not by merkle you ' re really missing the point , aren ' t you ? they ' re trying to keep parliament out of it , i . e . there ' s no control by parliament at all . so where are the people who will ratify the laws from ? you ' re assuming that because a government has a majority in parliament , it doesn ' t need to debate or vote on laws ? dangerous position . they pass them anyway if they have a majority lets face it most mp ' s are bent and professional mp ' s fiddling expenses oh . you think that governments never lose in parliament ? history is going to prove you wrong there . . . no sometimes they do but its rare and needs a strong opposition which we dont have at the moment

so when i realized half the shit i do and don ' t do are things i forced on myself just to try and fit in , i fell apart . that ' s really it . there ' s not much left when you realize that most of who you are is a sick lie . i tried to fix myself , but i also realized how alone i am . people always say they ' ll be there for you , but that ' s just to make you feel better . how could they help what they don ' t understand . nobody ever tried to talk to me . or ask if i ' m okay . fuck , or just say hello . not friends or family . i was just left to myself . i ' m not even upset about that . i shouldn ' t have expected people to understand , or try to with someone as broken as i was at the time . again , it effects every trans person differently . but my situation made it real easy to let my paranoia get the best of me . didnt seem so crazy to not trust people again . to resent them cause they couldn ' t tell how you felt or wanted help . i know they just hate me i ' ve had to live with paranoia my whole life . i got somewhat of a grip on it , but after everything fell down i stopped keeping it in check . but i guess after enough time the worst of it passes . i managed to get myself back at least a fraction of what stability is like again . i also finally realized i don ' t want to do this on my own . years later and i ' m no closer to changing myself . and i ' ll never get there .

no need to build it twice . save and duplicate any structure with the copy tool ! share your creations w / lego worlds 🏠 ✂ 🏠 one of the most important tools in the game . quite useful <happy> i love how you only respond to people who praise the game , but completely ignore any type of support question / complaint . terrible company ! you love that ? odd . it was sarcasm . . . same , you should consider that they may not reply to every single person about a single problem . the game had a hard start . they are not replying to any of us or saying anything about the patch that never came - nothing . total silence about it . they have already released two patches since the release , tt have never made a game like this before . be patient . yes , for pc and the ps4 . there has been none for xbox . . .

you try to put something on for your own people because you see a " need " . yet some where that message was lost . that ' s sad . i ' ve been on this campus for second now . i ' ve seen real discrimation at places like chasers where it ' s truly racist . . . where if u didn ' t fit a certain mold , you weren ' t allowed in period . our campus lacked a place for poc to kick it regularly ! how could a place be racist when we seek out student orgs collab with and to give opportunities nobody else is offering ? 🤔 when is the last time we had greek orgs & other student orgs hostin weekly events where its cheap / simple & student focused ? the reason i feel so strongly is because this whole move started with a focus to empower multicultural orgs . . . period . . . ! ! ! & the biggest issue is a dress code ? are y ' all gonna be still complainin about wearing golds , durags , sweats @ the club ? i think the issue is that because it ' s a college bar . . . not club but bar why is there such a strict and specific dress code . that i mean realistically is geared towards people of color , no jordans , no jean shorts , what are people going to wear when it ' s warm outside .

do you resent high school teachers needing college degrees too ? i don ' t , but i still don ' t like the licensing standards for teachers . if teachers compensated based on performance , we wouldn ' t need mandatory degree . like other professions , performance more imp . than degree i learned a lot in my phd , it ' s not a piece of paper . same is true for college . but sure , we could give exams instead to see what they know .

even if you are quite to the left and think j . gorsuch should be filibustered , it is self defeating to target red state dem senators / it ' s not manchin or heitcamp who hold decisive votes that could actually stop gorsuch . same with mccaskill and donnelly / i can see pressuring and punishing them if their votes were decisive . but they are not . dems should hold pressure for vote that matter / and pressuring them otherwise , or threatening to primary them from the left in these red states is self defeating / with dem senators standing to lose more seats in unless there ' s a big wave , dems need those red state senators to survive / and if dems do worse in , there ' s a chance rs could get votes , and then no legislation can be filibustered / so be outraged at our political situation and pressure where it matters . but be smart , and not just running on outrage / i think that ’ s setting the bar pretty low . sanders ’ message can work in red states . people respond . not the time to be timid . sanders ' s message can attract attention in red states , but neither he nor his message can win elections there . how do you know ? the democratic establishment never tries it . iron law of institutions and all that .

wouldn ' t it be awesome if one of these conservative politicians actually bothered to learn what planned parenthood actually does ? i guess i ' m don ' t get why we have to fund a private business with government money , healthcare is a service not a right pp is a non - profit that provides valuable health care services to women & families . govt funds a host of private businesses thru grants etc a majority of hospitals are also non - profit and can provide mammograms w / o sending patients offsite with referrals
i disagree with the removal of gordhan & jonas based on a suspect intelligence report . their committment to the ndr is unquestionable . pravin & jonas will never sell their soul and country to foreign forces . that is plain rubbish . their crime is their incorruptibility . their other crime is defence and protection of our public purse with highest levels of integrity and morality . we stand with them .

anyone still think corbyn can become pm ? or swing scotland back to labour ? which was always based on the ' lefty scots ' myth anyhow had they very conversation with we might be to the left of england but we ' re far from a left wing nation yep . social attitude surveys consistently put the population centre right . snp have done amazingly at exploiting the perception of leftism centre right doesn ' t vote for free stuff srly ? in true sense of " right " ? if it also benefits them , yes . if i wasn ' t on the phone i ' d find the links , but as a nation our social attitudes aren ' t as left as we think . totally agree . snp are a centre party & that suits , including their tax policies . folk are going mental at the ct rise the current uk gov is considered centrist .

did you wake up a jerk today or did you mum make you this way patrick ? if you can so easily dismiss peoples problems lets talk about yours . i have dealt with anxiety my entire life andy . in fact reading about your struggles helped me overcome mine . i performed for years . it ' s all to do with bad parental programming , i struggle with lack of confidence . glad you are licking yours . any tips ? andy , i ' ve concluded that the roots of our shit are wired into us . be as kind to yourself as you ' ve been to us ( with your gift of music ) . the mundane gives me more anxiety then say performing or directing now . the business of music and life is infinity more stressful to me . music still pours out of me , its just i need outlets , not myself , others to sing the songs would be ideal . more monkees , miles kane etc etc . might sound like reproach , but mean it as praise : do u ever stop think about the 1 0 0 0 s & 1 0 0 0 s of us who walk around singing your songs ? yes , and it makes me feel . . . sort of warm , a bit embarrassed and that i don ' t deserve to know it somehow . yeah , i get that . anyhow , not trying to embarrass you . just to say " thank you " very deeply .

lmao not actually the concept of race didn ' t even exist until the 1 5 th century ce and was largely based on arbitrary physical feauturws actually it comes p directly from michael james ' s study on race from the stanford library which is very well respected on the topic i don ' t know whether or not he ' s black but either way i don ' t see how that ' s relevant at all to the validity of his research if race isn ' t just skin color then what is it ? what fundamentally classifies someone in a particular race ?

covington has a " slight " lateral meniscus tear in his right knee . done for the season .
it looks great and it just isn ' t . fight me . … ‘ it ’ is the rare remake that actually feels necessary … it ' s not fair though . it had limitations being that it was a made for tv movie . it was good for what it could show . to clarify : i don ' t think it is bad cause it couldn ' t show some of the nastier bits . i think it ' s bad cause it ' s poorly made .
let ' s talk about the whitewashed trainwreck that is " ghost in the shell " . . . if you still want to watch the movie : beware of spoilers . spoiler the movie argues that scarlett johannson is actually japanese . the whitewashing is a plot point . it still leaves me speechless . spoiler the plot twist is that scarlett johansson is the brain of the japanese girl motoko kusanagi in the body of a white person . no the plot is that kusanai is in the body of an android , which , in the original anime , didn ' t look anything asian whatsoever . i mean the original director of ghost in the shell disagrees with you so . . find another soapbox ? . … so ? he ' s getting a fat check for using his property . i , the viewer and fan of the original , am not . don ' t expect me to be objective about it true , he ' s being paid . also , he ' s not asian american and doesn ' t get the issues . here . he probably thinks america is white & that ' s normal . why disregard the views of a japanese person on this ? does concerns of asian - americans take primacy on japanese cultural issues ? i ' m opposed to johansson ' s ( rinko kikuchi obviously ) , but it is a japanese product so their perspectives should be taken into account . true , but i ' ve long had issues with anime , the blue eyes ( with japanese names ) and blonde hair power ups in dbz

any gop healthcare plan will be an albatross around gop necks for years . even if perfect , it will never be good enough , always compared u want inaction then & have people pay / mo . in premiums & annual deductible ? what a lame statement , basically do nothing ? maga i think i may just pay my doctor out of pocket . it ' s way too expensive . when paying in cash is cheaper than the policy and the deductible , what does that say to you ? i sort of still have it , lost my plan , it went up and deductible is . so what is the point . would have saved thousands .

that ' s exactly my point ! ! that ' s what makes it kinda iffy because i think tbh the only people who can truly speak on it are rastas bc for all we know it ' s all the same to them on the subject of non - rastas wearing those kind of accessories like my grandparents are from grenada and there are plenty of cultural crossovers w / jamaicans ( auntie uncle even went through a rasta phase ) but it ' s like rasta is a religion too so even though it ' s jamaican in its roots it spread so it ' s hard to define it as a cultural issue it ' s all so complicated man i ' ve never thought about this so deep besides feeling uncomfortable when white people wear it to be funny literally djkfhdk i know for a fact that makes me mad and uncomfortable as hell but like this . this is one of those cases where context will determine with its appropriation or appreciation so also i ' m literally ? ? ? ? at people saying that black stans should decide whether its offensive or not when . . not all black stans are jamaican / caribbean so actually their opinion doesn ' t really matter when deciding if it ' s offensive or not either ? ? ? like jkdhkjd that ' s what ' s getting me 💀 that makes them just as ignorant if they think all blacks can speak on it sjdjdjd

stirring up hate again . until pp provides prenatal care , stitches and mammograms you can ' t claim they provide " basic " health care . … with so much at stake , i struggle to understand why republican leaders are fixated on controlling women ’ s access to basic health care . there r walk in clinics all over the country that provide low cost basic hc ( but not abortion ) . i took my kid one this week . if more people knew how few pp locations there are compared to walk in clinics they would probably stop their screaming . we have citymd clinics and they are superb . i often opt to go there kids sick visits instead of ped . much easier and same svce

" it isn ' t ? " never told her or maybe , because soare had told him he didn ' t previously have all his memories from asgard , maybe he didn ' t remember before . she could manage to say , not meeting his eye and pretending to be enthralled with the view as she took a very small step away from him . could sense the unease in the air . " that ' s what i care about . " you a good meal . " she didn ' t let go of his hand as she opened a portal back to the alley they came from . wasn ' t allowed to show he had a human form . " where do you want to go ? " he asked her at length to avoid the thoughts in his mind . could go either way , being that his tastes for the food had probably developed over time . that told him not to go . " what place is it ? " he wondered and kept close to her . relief brand of humor . " they have really good food . " she tried to smooth over her misstep of words . feelings away , letting himself just be in the moment .

" shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase ? " aha ! answered the very final question already . i can imagine these guys used to discuss these issues extensively . . . we hardly do these days , which is sad . . yes . a lot of philosophical introspection and interlocutory arguments were made as far back as written records go . including the bible

that fantasy land is like … ?

" what ' s preventing my suggestions from being suitable in that world ? what would need to be true ?

( crazy not having one tho ! ) it was a decision to remove pre - loaded applications so you can enjoy a clutter - free experience that is completely customizable . i get that , but i thought music would have been a standard . p / m isn ' t exactly a duplicate of htc ' s original ( excellent ) free app .

the uk has a level of sovereignty , but not enough . i would also suggest the economic evidence disputes your claim . uk has sovereignty . . how much do you need . rules & regulations made by qualified majority voting amongst countries is not sovereignty . north korea is only country in world with that . wto is similar to eu sovereignty argument is nonsense when less than of companies export a natural realignment of rules & regs , to be more suitable , will be economically beneficial . i really hope all you brexiters are right because my children ' s future in uk depends on it . however , i think you have just taken a massive gamble and have no idea what will happen . for those of us without these brexit specs it is a very worrying time let ' s not forget that the status quo was not on the ballot paper . the eu constantly evolves and always towards expanding its role . ballot was eu in / out conflated into cu and sm with immigration . . rather comical the single market and customs union are the heart of the eu . as stated by cameron , osborne , gove & boris we would leave the sm .

years ago , the top owned about of our nation ’ s wealth . today , that same owns of the wealth . i really do not feel there is anything wrong with wealth if it acquired legally and ethically & the worker bees are cared for sadly the wealthy have never cared for the needs of the " worker bees " therein lays the country ' s problems
right and i ' m sure all legal channels were ok ' d . guess my mind goes to what cinema will be like in yrs ? will james dean have a new movie ? and in both cases , you have a real living actor also involved . james dean will never make a movie again . peter cushing " made " rogue one though right ? so to speak . couldn ' t a studio use a double then digitize dean ' s face for some michael bay pic ? peter cushing ' s image is in the film . peter cushing is not . no one ' s ever going to get further than that . dead is dead . . i don ' t have a big issue here , just wonder how far we ' re away from some boardroom speech a la the player how we won ' t need actors anymore we have to re - educate people . it ' s digital make - up , not the reanimation of the dead . you still need an actor to drive the performance .

i can ' t even afford that healthcare because of the politician cronies who let big pharmacies jack up the prices . honestly , it ' s the same situation to not be able to access healthcare as not having it . i mean , it not existing . a lot of this countries ' poor people have died prematurely to conditions that are painfully easy to cure . you tell me that it is different from centuries ago , i don ' t get to see that reality . i may not be stricken with polio , but it doesn ' t take polio to kill someone . right , but even a couple hundred centuries have not served people like me well at all , let alone the country my parents came from .

do check the sermon . i actually address other atheist assertions in it . main material starts after 4 min intro . why believe a god ? are you afraid lf admitting to not know ? there are numerous things i do not know . i fear none of them . however there are also things i cannot deny therefore i am not an atheist . fear and doubt are closer cousins than fear and faith . sophistry helps no one . . . i did give direct answer to the alleged contradictions of christians dying and wife after death . . . yet no rebuttal but sophistry . . . " wife " after death ? you mean " life " ? no " wife " . it was pun on the multiple wives scenario posed by a detractor to the afterlife concept . what afterlife ? none demonstrated yet . just a claim . no scientific explanation for love , good , or morality . i guess they don ' t exist . can u measure such things imperically . no . must not exist .

solid thread abt mindfulness re : counterproductivity of being vindictive to trumpers . my rich / right trumpy parents are still dead to me tho … rhetoric about holding trump voters accountable makes me really uncomfortable , esp given laser focus on already suffering rural communities . yeah i told an uncle and a cousin the next time we speak will be when they repent . easier to deal with strangers than family .
( for the sake of your fans at the back of the line & your noble event coordinator who has to stay til the end ) more intimate the group , the more time you can take . larger events require more expediency but you can still take a few moments to engage . even if the line coordinator is using post - it notes , ask the readers name or ask them a simple question . a moment of engagement = memories . if you have a comfortable size group at a bkstore , say – people , the event + signing should be – hours . pub tip book marketing a story time it will likely be much shorter . a panel or workshop , might run longer . talk to your venue & see what their expectations are . i coordinated bookstore events for four years , i ' ve seen it all . tweet me & i ' ll answer your burning book event questions . book marketing if an author was local and wanted to do a signing , would you be willing to stock their indie title ? if the book was a good fit for the store & easy to stock ( either thru distrib or consignment ) then yes . as for a signing , would depend . . . / can the author guarantee an audience ? what kind of mktg are they doing ? would need assurance the author is doing their part ? . . . / same criteria for all authors but indie need to prove themselves a bit more as bkstores know the mktg efforts of big pub ; indie untested .

yavanas ( ionians / greeks ) were regarded by indians as mlecchas ( inferior , barbarians ) . indians did not copy / acquire greek customs . … on the other hand , greeks who conquered north - western regions of india ( present - day afghanistan ) became indianized . indo - greeks like king milinda ( menander ) adopted indian religion & culture & greek population assimilated with indian population . indian ladies were forced to cover up their faces & bodies under layers of clothes only after the islamic invasions . the अवग ु ण ् ठन existed before islamic invasions , though i agree that it became more common after islamic invasions . covering the full face was uncommon though , except in times of sadness ( e . g sumantra weeping before dasharatha ' s death in adhyatma ramayana )

everything is this thread . … i think it ' s important to keep reading these . we need to understand these people . including realizing that this is exactly what they want . … and this goes back to the core argument of trump voters : everything that directly helps *them* is worthwhile . everything *else* is " waste " . they voted for trump because they wanted that " waste " gone . they ' ll stick with him even if they are hurt * as long as poc are hurt more * . trump offered identity politics and people with that identity voted for him , period . everything else is there to justify why they made that choice . " well dems called us deplorable so of course i voted to hurt them . " you can ' t reason with someone in denial like that . they ' ll just find another excuse to justify their actions . gop did that daily with obama . there was always another outrage that obama was guilty of that justified the gop refusing to work with him . same goes with trump voters . there will always be another outrage to prevent them from turning on trump .

i get skeptical of titles that contain " the truth about . " " this is why , " " the real reason , " because they often see things one - dimensionally . speaking of actual objective truth is not presumptuous nor prideful , but hardly anyone is speaking of such truths when they say " my truth . "

the fragmentation of the media and the public space , the emergence of fanaticism , are making it harder to reach consensus politicians that seek consensus are penalized . gerrymandering makes this worse - increasingly , extreme views prevail and increasingly , we view people who disagree as people who don ’ t belong in the same country . this leads to fragmentation we need to reclaim a new patriotism , where we celebrate diversity of views , honest disagreement , as a strength no . tolerating intolerance will lead to no tolerance left in this world . it ' s the paradox of tolerance theory . you are broadening my point to find a nonexistent disagreement . classic logical fallacy . i said nothing about tolerating racism . i did not make an absolute point about tolerating everything i am simply pointing out that we need to seek coomin ground on matters of policy . automatic disagreement . . . on everything , solves nothing and serves no purpose . worse , renders legitimate opposition meaningless the default attitude should be : let us listen to each other . let us try . if we fail , then we fight . not before
this anime ' s got the toradora feeling but something about the characters is . . . weird so far . i heard toradora ever seen tonari no kaibutsu - kun ? … i absolutely adore this show . natsume was gonna be first waifu but i didnt know what a waifu was when i first watched it i ' ve just started watching and it feels similar but not ? can ' t put my finger on it . i agree to an extent . the character dynamics are similar albeit reversed yeah and it ' s a bit more . . harsh ? in ways . it ' s so far interesting . i could see that . i think it has to do with the fact that the characters backstory is front loaded as opposed to td where it ' s shown thruout kinda balances out later on cuz of the main dude . glad ur enjoying it

bank statements don ' t mean anything ! there are ways to see if someone is a successful trader or not , which is the most important thing to do please rt so that people don ' t get scammed any more by forex traders that just come out the wood work firstly , any trader / company trading for other people , needs to have a financial services provider ( fsp ) number not just any fsp number , but one particularly for fund management in forex / commodities / stocks depending on where that person will be trading secondly , they have to have a trading account with a track record of successful trades and growth of that account . brokers issue monthly . . . . statements to clients showing their progress on a particular account and percentage growth or depletion , percentage of successful trades remember , firstly that an fsp number is important for fsb & sars compliance . if that person is a successful trader but no compliance . . . . sars & / or fsb can freeze all the assets and equity ( trading account ) of that person / company and have investigations that go on for years and it takes years for those assets to be unfrozen , due to endless court proceedings . and your money will be in frozen as well keep in mind that other fraudsters use this as an excuse to be able to disappear with your money and therefore blame the government

need to leave london because of brexit ? come to dublin . apart from our housing crisis , health crisis , and transport crisis , it ' s perfect . the pale shouldn ' t define us as a country . but hey , stay positive cathal . the idea that the pale defines us is ridiculous . until we hear different , this brexit bank / financial companies competition is between cities . too much focus on dublin . ire has lots to offer in other regions & narrow focus doesn ' t help . multiple cities in same eu states discussed something worth thinking about , if london banks / companies are willing . meanwhile , dublin ' s the only city we hear is being considered , so far . hence my point . dub saturated and policy makers fixiated with capital . imagine if google moved to spiddal would economy colapse ! the big city focus is not just an irish phenomenon . toulouse , bilbao , palermo etc aren ' t in the post - brexit move frame either , for the moment seems to be a mantra here which influences policy . really , germany have number of places in mind as to others . pitching dub only won ' t work doubt if the govt would mind if eg jp morgan wanted to out of dublin .

actually the problem is " this student identiifed herself & asked how to implement the school sanctioned accommodation " & it was questioned then the student was asked to identify person information while meeting resistance about the single accommodation that was being asked about then no further contact with the student was read as " success " for the writer to encourage other profs as " don ' t dread the accommodation talk " the " what do you usually do to avoid panic attacks " is hippa information - a student shouldn ' t have share that get what ' s on the paper oh man this is what i meant : " college at risk " . it ' s about the *student* not the college . this cannot be a healthy atmosphere for anyone . they made it a legal risk in part to protect students from professors who think they know what ' s best . this issue is like an ouroboros . it just cycles back on itself . i could imagine an essay on this theme that was actually good . it would say things like " we met regularly to discuss goals and needs " and " she thanked me at the end . "

here ' s what sadiq khan thinks of ed miliband ' s marr claim that tories are plotting to get rid of workers ' rights … my gut feeling is , cons will not remove the rights , rather you ’ ll reduce them , which is just as bad . uk has in many cases - better than eu min standards . labour allowed undermining of rights through allowing zero hrs and contracted no rights are our rights better than comparable countries ? like france & germany . not sure how lab undermined zero hrs contracts 🤔

riley ? who undermined buffy , cheated on her , made her doubt her ability to love ? yeah , no thanks lol … all of buffy ' s men were not healthy accept the human , riley . well he is better . spike was a mess himself . if she dated kendra that would have been better but they killed her off ( 💔 ) i wouldn ' t consider a man who made her feel lesser better , imo . if we ' re going female partners , reformed faith works for me all of them were shady af . faith who betrayed her till the last episode 😷 . at least kendra died being great faith became a better character , same with spike . same with buffy herself . i do respect earned & intentional redemption same with angel , if you watched his spin off eh . he always took his " redemption " as a burden & it was never his choice , so it feels less earned , imo but to continue living ? he could have just gave up ( attempt suicide again ) etc but he chose to live with the guilt and do good .
i don ' t even understand how she could think we would not want to <laugh> i ' ve said numerous times i ' m dying to do tales idoles lol and you too i know it ' s complicated schedule wise for everyone buuuuut i haven ' t seen you ask i ' m sorryyyy but yes the hype to cosplay tob with you is still here <laugh> i ' m not sure who will do it though i ' m trying to make selica but it ' s a very random character xddd shiina will probably wear velvet again but other than that . . .

ok . thread . on world autism awareness day here are some ways you can support actually autistic people directly . this is going to be mostly patreons , wishlists , etc of adults . but one great way of direct support of families with children is this : check in how they ' re doing . offer to help w small things . ( you can also ask families for amazon wishlist link , many people have one . ) a lot of autistic kids have very few friends and social opportunities . you can offer to hang out with them , or do some activity .

e01 is a good start for peaky blinders ' season , with heartbreaking and gasp inducing revelations . much like polly though , i despise grace . but most importantly , it re - established just how lovely the shelby brothers are while introducing all the key players in the business . in a typical peaky blinders fashion , e02 dragged us deeper into the pit as it laid down eggs for upcoming thunderstorm and bleak sky . tension is running high in e03 as it explored both the risk and the ups of running a family business . it ' s an unusual humane glance on the shelbys , so of course i ' m mesmerised . so far , this season has been keeping it tight and pleasing . plus points for the soundtrack . just like previous seasons , it all comes crashing down in e04 . started out strong but fell off the wagon , it ' s the weakest episode so far .

the problem is they have no backround . they just appeared in the fossil record , which is impossible in light of the amount of time / evolutionists say it takes for species to evolve . noncomplex life - - complex life in unrealistic time ( according to your own theory ) how many strawman " misconception " memes have you spent your precious years before you die , get wiped from history , and go nowhere on ? even if all knowledge was wiped out , the concept of evolution by natural selection would more likely be rediscovered than the bible rewritten god would be more likely to give his word again than man coming up with evolution again . they would just create a different lie to avoid god evolution was made to avoid god . it doesn ' t automatically disqualify god . it ' s a steppingstone to atheism . how many strawmans do you have ? evolution wasn ' t made . evolution is a natural , observed process that has been going on for nearly 4 bn years .

can what you think you know about someone affect how you hear them ? … that ’ s a super cute study ! can you confirm that the folks hearing the us talker believed it was a nzer ? did you ask after ? i didn ' t specifically ask about thier beliefs , but i did have an option for them to contact me , and no one brought up the mismatch . although someone did very helpfully get in touch to let me know that i didn ' t have any " hid " tokens in my training data . <happy>

i often tell people read the mahabharta . it is my most fav epic . vyasa s book is not a book of right or wrong but a book of karma . 4 n and as my lord krishna after the war has two women crying for their loved ones in his arms . . one draupadi the other gandhari 5 n vyasa makes you think . . was the war needed ? who won ? both sides lost all their children ( save one of the pandavas child ) & there sits 6 n and there sits lord krishna with both the mothers , as they both cry , the cycle of hate , revenge and war . the cycle must end . 7 n so a smiling lord krishna accepts gandhari ' s curse . no retaliation . no anger . no revenge . this now must end . . and therefore 8 n and therefore vyasa shows us why dharma was not the pandava ' s or the kaurava ' s but only lord krishna was dharma . . coz he accepted even a 9 n coz my krishna accepted even a curse that was to end his time on earth without a retaliation . that is why krishna is dharma . 1 0 n krishna loves like no one can yet he is unattached . krishna accepts the day with the night , the good with bad , strength with weakness . 1 1 n yet krishna the only man who will have lost on both sides - is a part of the war . yet despite being a part of the war , he urgues for peace n lord krishna is contradictory yet there is no one more simple than him . vyasa teaches us krishna is dharma . . yet mahabharata is abt karma .

we ' re always supposed to use the electoral college . different states have different interests . otherwise , we ' re all slaves to cali & ny right now those metropolis ' s are slaves to small counties more susceptible to propaganda . liberal default = intellectual supremacy mindset . does it not occur to you that people living outside of a big cities are well educated too ? this will take us into uncomfortable depths . . . the current political divide along racial and socioeconomic lines is prominent . from your point of view . from ours the divide has nothing to do with identity politics , that ' s a lefty thing . no it ' s an indifference thing . most republicans align with the " well off " and most of america ' s wealth was received through ill gotten gains no , it ' s not indifference , we ' re passionate about politics . we don ' t see much difference between a republican and democrat . same owners . it ' s obvious you do , many statements begin with " left " , " lefty " , " leftists " , blah blah . . . that ' s a defining term of division . meanwhile our oppressors use a whole arsenal of untrue labels to make us villains deserving of violence and death . the right doesn ' t do that the right creates code words that equal your enemy is the less fortunate . . . which was made that way by racism and capitalism .

she forgets that she gets to spend her life behind a desk , getting paid to produce nothing , instead of actually having to work for a living . climate scientists produce knowledge about our planet that helps with business and policy decisions . helped attempt to destroy businesses and craft flawed policy . not at all useful in my book . climate data is used in the day to day operations of agriculture and utility businesses , and climate policy can be good for the economy . tell that to the coal and oil industry . a price on carbon is flexible and predictable , which businesses love because it helps them plan and innovate . and they pass the costs on to the consumer . . . . everyone wins , except the consumer , of course . . . the consumer wins in the form or a dividend check or reduced taxes if the policy is revenue - neutral . except that ' s not the way " carbon tax " works . govt keeps the money and the consumer gets the shaft legislators can write the tax in a way that ensures it is revenue neutral .

rt this for a follow 🖤 gonna do a little spreeee
and people were all around very nice ! everyone was just having fun and hanging out and there was dancing and singing so i saw some water bottles on the ground and like a few photo cards that got dropped but it didn ' t seem like there was that much trash there were army going around with trash bags collecting the trash and that ' s so nice they are amazing and wonderful but i think some people exaggerated the trash and to say bts shouldn ' t come back to anaheim is harsh because everything seemed fine to me so i met some really nice people ( and i love our fandom everyone is really nice and lit ) i was there alone so i had to make friends and it - - was surprisingly easy i hung out with some really cool girls in line and my seat section was really awesome and lit no one judged me for being there alone and everyone was super easy to talk to so when the concert started namjoon said at the beginning not to push and then he didn ' t have to say it again for the rest of the concert s - - o even though i wasn ' t in or near the pit i assume that it was pretty safe and that there wasn ' t too much pushing but i would go ask some - - one who was in the pit for confirmation about that .
a long time ago this user on insta asked to do an at and i just started so i was like sure and i haven ' t done it and lol but like - first of all this user only wanted to at to get more followers and she ' s and i ' m like eh idc and then she did her part of the trade - and then just sent it to me direct message and didn ' t post it ? ? and i was oh lol all right thanks and then she messaged me - how should we share our trades ? and i ' m like , what other way is there to idk uhhh post and tag ? ? ? idk i feel bad but like - i remember her message for asking to at was like " u have more followers than me let ' s trade " so like i have no will to do it lmao and it ' s not like i have that much more followers than her only more so idk it ' s annoying lmao stop bugging me please it was months ago

you can ' t get wealthy on minimum wage . period . you can limp along , paycheck to paycheck , going into debt . no matter where you live . you can not get sick . you can ' t go a day w / o working - in fact you need to work overtime . your whole check is fucked if you get a migraine . you can ' t have a health emergency , because even if you have insurance you ' re not making extra to cover the deductible .
if they won , they needed immediate action to keep from getting caught - they had to disable the us intelligence community . that ’ s where mike flynn and devin nunes appear to have come in . flynn would put bannon on the nsc . nunes would run cover . jiim clapper retires as dni . they talk about getting rid of odni . nunes picks the dircia . they take the ic and joint chiefs off the nsc . they advance the completely insane idea of having some new york financier “ streamline ” the entire intelligence community . bwahahaha meanwhile , bannon , miller , and trump start “ deconstructing the administrative state ” and the new apnsa , mike flynn starts on intel matters . the billionaires - ross , devos , and others - descend on the us government like they ’ re flies on a carcass . but they all misjudged . badly . two weeks after starting the utter insanity of “ getting rid of ” the us intelligence community , mike flynn suddenly resigns . see , they were all so sure that this plan would work they didn ’ t take basic precautions . the white house and pence make up a story . the first conspirator got pinched . the rest are all like long - tailed cats in a room full of rocking chairs . they don ’ t know what to do . every day , a new piece of the story emerges . manafort . botnets . russian ambassadors . carter page and rosneft . it all comes out . slowly .

nothing prepared me for the train wreck that is trump post - inauguration except for the train wreck that was trump pre - inauguration yeah , wasn ' t a lot of mystery about how it would all turn out . if i read another , " we thought he might change " take , my head is for - sure going to explode . i ' m with the la times : we knew he ' d be a disaster , but not one trying so hard to be the biggest disaster of all time .
why would they nuke the filibuster now knowing that doing so would clear the way for a more extreme nominee next time ? i think the repubs *want* to nuke , for exactly that reason . i ' m not sure why dems are playing along . why not give votes here & wait ? you argued that collins / murkowski might be pro - nuke now but anti - nuke w / a future appointee . i don ' t understand that logic at all . yea , bc : now : ⬆️ qualified man replacing male consvtv justice = pro - nuke . future : ⬇️ qualified , replacing ( female ? ) lib = potentially anti - nuke . but nuking the filibuster is permanent , and thus opens door for an unqualified male nominee replacing a female liberal justice later on . yea i know . are you thinking collins et al . will refuse to go along with nuke this time ? i doubt it . they ' ll nuke , unless dems give . i think it ' s ludicrous to think that dems being " reasonable " will sway a single republican vote on anything . not how the senate gop works . show me a single example from the last ~ years of a gop senator , on an important vote , rewarding democrats for being reasonable .

i just now realized that makn x makes a lot more sense if you interpret it as a 3 d beat em up instead of a first person shooter .
black women continuously yell out " all natural hair is beautiful " and yet slander the black women who don ' t have 4 c hair . according to black women poc are all beautiful but if there isn ' t a dark skinned woman in the photo / video , etc . the representation is off . upset about this video ? kendrick has showed continuously amount of love to mostly dark skin women but he always includes all shades . for example . and these are only of his videos . to say kendrick never shows love to the 3 c - 4 c hair black women is beyond false . what ' s interesting to me though is that artists like migos , future , all the " lil " rappers , etc say the most outlandish things but its ok . isn ' t forcing any black woman to no longer get work done or go all natural . i took it as him stating the obvious . he ' s tired of the photoshopped women in videos , with all the same hair texture , and look . hence how she went from glam to herself . now if this is actually a drake diss then that line makes perfect sense + it fits with all the current rappers and their videos .

trump had no prior or current relationship with manafort . he gave manafort a shot , the guy failed , trump fired him and forgot about him . funny because manafort & stone founded a lobbying firm in dc in & stone & trump have been close forever . . . . and ? and the claim that trump didn ' t know manafort prior to hiring him is not true . he said he had shared an elevator with him from time to time , manaford lived in the building lol , ) trump never lies ? ) manafort & stone ( & trump ) used to party at studio in nyc in the 7 0 s .

my sincerest apologies . i never meant to target , offend , or come across as insensitive . i tried on a movie prop . please forgive . april fools no need to apologize . too many people take and make someone else ' s april fools joke about them and / or their agenda . tell that to my best friend , whose miscarriage years ago caused physical damage that may make her unable to have children . you also don ' t know her story either . cast stones elsewhere . what story can she possibly have to justify her dismissal of honest criticism of an insensitive " joke " ? that ' s the point . you don ' t know . and if she was dismissive would she apologize . . 🤔 if you don ' t accept it move around . communication error - - i thought your " she " was referring to the person who i had replied to , not shawn . but - - shawn ' s " story " was literally , " let ' s pretend i ' m pregnant for april fool ' s day ! " she made that choice and is living with the consequences .

is it me or do the new men ' s and women ' s nxt championships remind you of the old tna x division championship ? probably fitting since vince will probably buy impact / tna in months after jarrett / anthem fails just so he can fire double j a second time . except this time it ' s hhh with a shovel " burying " jeff instead of vince … what do guys make of shaq ? big show vs shaq was the first match booked for mania , almost a year in advance . very disappointing sad big show didn ' t get his singles match , glad i didn ' t have to see him job out to an ex - basketball player
omfg . . . red dress chick , obama ' s kids were in a limo for protection , as is trump kid . . . what is her problem ? the point
we ' ve got the right coaches . now we just need to win consistently . the rest will take care of itself . facilities make a big statement to perspective recruits . baseball and basketball need serious upgrades . help these coaches recruit . build it & they will come doesn ' t work . great coaches recruit great players . winning brings $$ $ and demand required for new facilities . there is a balance in this . basketball and baseball are way overdue . agree with the state of our facilities . especially baseball but how do you justify a million arena when attendance avg is around ? starting winning & sell out convo center on a regular basis . then you justify new arena cost . utsa is leading with the right sport , imo , though there seems to be a lot of opportunity in basketball .
if you are always asking , who do you have to be for someone to love you , no one will ever be able to truly love you . be yourself . love yourself . share your spirit , but protect your heart . the right one will find you , and love who you are ❤️ i used to change myself all the time . feel the guy out first to figure out what type of girls he likes so i could be just that . i never took the time to think , that if i become someone else for him to like me , when will he ever truly meet me ? and there ' s nothing crazier than you being someone else , and then unveiling yourself in the middle of a relationship . just because the last person you were with didn ' t cherish you , that doesn ' t mean you ' re not a jewel . don ' t change yourself bc of rejection i have really started to just encourage myself , to always be myself . people wear sun screen & shades because they can ' t handle the sun . people block you bc of your shine , but day someone will bathe in you . ☀️
makoto didn ' t insisted further when took the task of washing the dishes to herself , naturally makoto kept the reason why he ✧ ✧ collapsed secretly to himself to avoid any tension around the dormitory . if he told them that ryoji appeared to him twice it would cause ✧ ✧ worries upon his comrades so the matter would stay in him alone as much as possible . ❝ yeah sure . ❞ he said to the brunette as he stood ✧ ✧ up and put his bowl on the sink . he walked into the lounge and sat on the couch , it still raining outside so the weather was a bit ✧
autism itself is a mix of positive , negative and neutral traits - you can lose the negative traits and remain autistic . exactly . all my professional experience has came from my " obsessive interest " in computing and that ' s a good thing .
i guess this will be a similar experience to the one i had with totoro . all the older ones that had grown with it are still fascinated by it

omw to japan and ran into monsta x and shinee at the airport . what ' s going on in japan ? ? i was heading to the lounge and i saw people with cameras going crazy and rushed over to see that it was monsta x going through security shinee was coming later so i went to chill in the lounge . i sat facing security and just as i was done eating i saw a scurry at security it was shinee and they had hella fans taking photos . so i just watched the beauties from afar 😊 it was almost time for my flight so i headed through security . just my luck that i went to the shortest line and shinee were in front of me i think that ' s the closest i ' ve ever been to shinee . guess they wanted to grace me with their presence since i couldn ' t see them in la 😓 got through security and walked around the boarding area . kihyun and jooheon walked passed me and my heart was racing ! ! i grabbed my notebook and pen and waited for them to come back or for the other members to come back . and then i see wonho walking toward me

not a pass no , he could lose his pension , benefits etc . if a crime occurred after he went inactive , civilian courts . flynn doesn ' t care about a pension . he has russian *millions* stashed away , probably offshore . yeah but if you are locked up you can ' t get to it flynn will end up testifying in exchange for a fairly light sentence in a cushy federal pen . his son will have control of the money . and you know what ? we should take it if it brings down trump & his backers . we can legally rico their assets & repair the damage . yet this damage is global and sad all at the same time reflecting irrational conduct and thinking w / professionalism lacking the whole thing is sad . it removes any illusions we may have had about the " line of history " moving toward greater morality & advancement .

former aren ' t beyond reaching . latter are despicable and unworthy of the effort . bullshit . so then awareness raising and education are hopeless ? should we just hope all the trumpers die or wait for idiocracy to come true ? the ppl for whom the blatant bigotry , the admitted sexual assault , wasn ' t a deal breaker , aren ' t easier to reach . just more polite . whether a trump voter is too attached to the r party to see reason or actively , intentionally bigots , they ' re just as entrenched . education is always valuable , of course , but part of being capable of being educated is being able to realize what one voted for . pretending there ' s a wide , identifiable divide bt shameless bigots & ppl who can look the other way over sa & open racism harms that . i say this as someone w family members that i love deeply who voted for trump . it ' s hard to recognize that lovable ppl are also bigoted . but bigotry was in play during every decision to look away from inexcusable behavior , whether the trump voter vocally embraced it or not .

who did it better
you deserve so much better and i wish i would ' ve felt that way throughout this whole experience . after splitting with my ex , he stalked me for months . i had to delete multiple twitters and change my phone number . i felt like god had abandoned me once again by letting my ex stalk me . it took awhile to learn that god was letting me know he was with me . that ' s one of the main reasons i created this twitter besides to meet god ' s people . i wanted to share my faith and testimony with others . my ex has never found this page . his relationship with god is terrible and i pray he truly finds god . i ' m still working on forgiveness , it ' s hard . especially since he doesn ' t acknowledge what he did . but god forgave me so i have to forgive him . i ' ve been on several dates after divorcing my ex . but the abuse always plays again in my head . praying for the day when it leaves my mind . ourselves that jesus is greater and bigger than those horrible memories that try to hold us down , we must remember that . i keep trying to think positive . my faith has grown because of that situation .

oh , maybe because now they ' re trying to frame any criticism of hillary as the work of russian trolls you are mischaracterizing what they are saying about russian trolls so that you can discredit the fact that it actually happened . look at this headline … and if you read beyond the headline it says that russian trolls targeted bernie supporters online . so , that makes the headline . . . what ? to me katie this vindicates both of our sides no it doesnt , because the article suggests " bernie bros " were dupes & that their support of sanders wasnt their own . yours isnt vindicated isn ' t it possible that a young / inexperienced subsection of male internet users were affected by misinfo campaign ? why is this so offensive . it absolutely possible . it was a terrible epidemic among hillary voters who actually believed she wasn ' t a pro - fracking warmonger . she wasn ' t a warmonger for gods sake . please let ' s debate this where i ' m not constrained to characters !

that even goes for when i ' m doing well . i ' m just kinda like " meh " in general , at best , about it now . ( / ) ( / ) and being " meh " about a game you ' d like to take seriously is not very constructive , to say the least . more often than not , i just find myself getting frustrated at what goes on in a game . even clutch comebacks feel just par for the course . i have my fair share of issues with the current state of the game ( even as a urien main ) and seeing the april balances in action ( / ) ( / ) through the cfn beta has further solidified a good bit of those issues for me . to the point i think it ' s best i step back for now . no idea if this will end up being permanent or not , but i ' d like to keep improving as a player and broaden my fg knowledge / experience ( / ) ( / ) and playing a game i ' m not feeling , not in the slightest , anymore is certainly not gonna help me achieve those goals . i ' ve not cemented what game i ' ll be transitioning to as my main game , but i ' ve been eyeing kof ( vanessa ' s back ) and gg as candidates ( / ) ( / ) and even if those don ' t end up being them , i ' d love to play them more , to explore them more , anyway . rev and kof dlc being right around the corner makes all the better a reason why now ' s a good chance to give them a real go .

there were so many times in the early 9 0 s when i needed somebody to say this to me . it ' s great advice for many reasons . … hey ! you ! you ' re working on something and you ' re thinking " nobody ' s gonna watch , read , listen . " finish it anyway . even if it isn ' t the piece of work that finds an audience , it will teach you things you could have learned no other way . ( and by the way , just because it didn ' t find an audience , that doesn ' t mean it ' s bad work . ) the discipline involved in finishing a piece of creative work is something on which you can truly pride yourself . you ' ll have turned yourself from somebody who ' s ' thinking of ' , who ' might ' , who ' s ' trying ' , to someone who did . and once you ' ve done it . . . . . . you ' ll know you can do it again . that is an extraordinarily empowering piece of knowledge . so do not ever quit out of fear of rejection . maybe your third , fourth , fiftieth song / novel / painting will be the one that ' makes it ' , that wins the plaudits . . . . . . but you ' d never have got there without finishing the others ( all of which will now be of more interest to your audience . ) here endeth today ' s sermon and thanks to for her original words of wisdom .

why did the eu not reform itself years ago ? … this has to be a rhetorical question . quite ironic really , leaving the eu will destroy young english people ' s lives . as has austerity . . . we did that within the eu . we ' ve had sufficient autonomy to fuck our own with relish for the last years . we ' ll soon realise that the eu ( although not perfect ) arnt the problem , it ' s our own government . . . eu is part of the problem , but not the only issue . i ' d rather stay in and try to reform it . the wto will be much worse . no reform possible in the eu we joined a common trading market not to be part of a federal europe the electorate have been duped south africa is in the eu ? 😊 . bankers debt & austerity a far bigger dupe . i am english leeds born and bred with a british passport and a vote

this thought itself is very dangerous imho if you ' re the from the south , you will know why that statement is valid . noone can validate that statement . see , ideologies can differ but as a nation we are one . the ideology that we are one is what making the north impose hindi , sanskrit , hindutva in the south . haven ' t we seen enough division already ? yes , & that ' s why india needs a coalesced central government , & strong state government . our federal powers are being deprived off from us . the nationalism the north have makes them not able to tolerate any criticisms about central govt . they hate anything other than rw too . and the nationalism of south makes them disapprove or rather hate anything central govt do ? central government didn ' t make cavery board as sc , they have not given compensation to our farmers yet , started hydro carbon so farmers ' pain making you tweet so viciously against the north indians 🙄

trump ' s presidency in summary : trump failing on all of his campaign promises gop making bold obama - directed accusations w / o any evidence and some of yall are just eating it up . it ' s incredible to watch . i mean the unmasking is real bro no one presented any evidence that any of this went on . no one has even so much has put their name to any of this . there ' s evidence they were unmasked . susan rice being the one to do it is new . it ' s clearly what nunes had . and it ' s a gigantic deal

get ready . buzz building on the right accusing susan rice of being alleged " unmasker . " " if " she is shown to have unmasked will you be calling for her to face charges ? what for ? whistleblowers are patriots and are protected . there are very specific laws about unmasking . i appreciate that you might hate djt but that ' s not whistleblowing . the convos were innocuous i think i ' ll stay focused on trump being an agent of ru ( all to win an election ) . f ' ing traitor he is straight up . unmasking = years for felony . good luck with that it ' s interesting you ' re much more interred in punishing the source than investigating the treason . should we use your same parameters for the information that came out of the dnc email leaks ?

for the past two days i ' ve been wondering if was just a long elaborate scheme to get back that szechuan sauce . you just know that sauce has been on justin roiland ' s mind since . man is fucking obsessed . don ' t blame ' em , you know how long i waited for the return of ecto - cooler hi - c ? but with the live action mulan movie coming it might happen . . . . i didn ' t even know they were doing a live action mulan film . presumably they ' ll get scarlett johansson to play mulan . nice one , but people are already pissed . they ' re removing the songs , so no be a man or reflection . i can ' t be arsed with these films . the cartoons are great . making clones with airbrushed former harry potter actresses is pointless . it ' s not art , it ' s weaponised nostalgia in the name of making money . had to figure out how to untag . the movies aren ' t really that great . i mean a movie that would benefit from today ' s cgi is one thing but they keep doing it with those that don ' t , adding pointless plot points , and doing a shit job of writing the story , plus unfitting actors . they do work out some bad plot points from the old movies but does little to make their remake great .

about to go on a frustrated rant about public funding for filmmakers in canada . may be enlightening for americans who think we have magic $ . . our biggest funds ( telefilm , harold greenberg fund ) require you to have already made a feature to qualify for development money . . hgf then only gives equity money if you ' ve gotten development money from them . telefilm might jump on later , after the hard work ' s done . . ( got pulled aside for a phone call - sorry ) telefilm would rather new filmmakers used their micro - budget program , but you ' ve got to be an . alum of one of their partner schools to qualify . cbc has a breaking barriers fund for women & poc - but again , must ' ve made a feature . . and arts councils ? to qualify for ontario arts council , must ' ve made a short outside of school to get funding , which bars a lot of folks . . and the canadian council for the arts doesn ' t say what their qualifications are , but it ' s hard to qualify for them , too . . that brings us to the national film board of canada , which is great - but only for shorts , animated , and documentary . no narrative money .

y ' all gotta know the pds of infinity challenge are awesome back in they did a collab of hip hop and history of south korea bc the presidential issue , they wanted to appeal more nationalism to young ppl by using hiphop . the rappers & casts even learned the history literally from the start . then each group picked a historical figure as an inspiration to make a song . their perfs were really awesome idk but this idea is really cool im also amazed that the pds dared to do that concept since we all know how dirty politic can be it doesn ' t stop there . recently infinity challenge made a comeback after a week hiatus and guess what this time ' s concept is a public sphere . where citizens met w / ic casts and national assembly members they discussed about what kind of law they want in various categories . idk what to say like that concept is beyond amazing i mean ic is a variety show & the fact that the pds had the idea to do this is so cool . that ' s very brave of them i ' m still amazed

" immediate improvement . positive reception , thanking me for suggestions , responds promptly , saying " great questions !

note that refuted nothing in the article it cites . instead , relies on the lazy old trope that media is bad . w a leg … making political points by playing games with these ( education ) numbers occurs w / depressing regularity . w a leg i read the wpc post and didn ' t find anything like the " lazy old trope " you implied was in there . did i miss something ? " while democrats in the house and the media dance their two - step , slicing and dicing school funding numbers to make political points . . . " still , the post prompts qs that have seem to have gone undiscussed in mccleary coverage . if policy expert found an error , she could have easily explained said error . instead : misdirection , suggestion & impugning motives . the qs that i feel are missing don ' t stem from whether everyone ' s in sync on budget jargon , but whether we ' re locked in on the right metric . that would have been a great contribution to the topic . problem w / cheap writing tricks : they ultimately subtract from one ' s own argument .

query do you describe pro brexit mps as having a view , or a bias ? is bias just for remainers ? no . we ' re all biased . i include myself . i do my best to take account of it , but i ' m not ( entirely ) perfect . however : remainers , i think . . / / . . . can be more extreme . ' catastrophe ; off a cliff ; brexiteers are racist morons who ' ve destroyed the future . brexiteers strongly . . . / before , some people were mildly uncomfortable on the train . now , we are all standing on the tracks . that justifies different responses . agreed . that and i ' m afraid i just don ' t accept the view that ' the other side are worse / nastier / ruder / intolerant ' . extremes on both sides . i accept extremes on both sides . both fucking rude . but there are plenty of experts on brexit side saying it ' s good , yet even you . . . / / . . . reasonable chaps speak of falling off cliffs & standing in front of trains . that ' s what i ' m referring to when speaking of difference . take a look at your own timeline when you describe the words , conduct and deeds of remainers . no different philip . no different . no . i accept that . i can fight my corner & am guilty of being rude & patronising . my point is : remainers never say ' brexit might make . . . / / . . . things worse ' . they all say things like ' brexit is a catastrophe delivered by morons ' . opinion , not fact . king & bootle aren ' t morons .

i think he was referring to death wish , which is also super strong ( and frankly tastes a little better than this insomnia brew ) death wish tastes like folgers 😩 geez , what kind of coffee do you drink over there ? do you just snort ground beans instead ? ha ! i ' m not a super snob , my bag of death wish was just awful . i drink anything out here , mostly . ( to be fair , i lowered my standards in europe . they aren ' t into coffee like we think , i think ) not into coffee ? … holland in 3 rd place , most of the list is european countries . it ' s like beer in the us . the median is awful , but the right tail is world class . i did find one beer in the us that i enjoyed - canebrake by . dislike ipas so much of us beer is off the table . too bad . stone ruination ipa is a religious experience i have not matched yet in europe . although tripel karmelite on tap is close . rochefort ( a quadrupel ) is the best beer i ' ve ever had in my life , hands down . i do love a good tripel though , westmalle is my favorite .

but it ' s insane to expect everyone to play the same way . the nba equivalent would be steph winning the nba title , so future prospects are evaluated on their gravity and ability to hit ridiculous ' s . of course , not everybody has this skill set , so nobody is expected to play like curry . yet this is exactly what nfl coaches want all qb ' s to be like . only in the nfl is the ability to scramble considered a detriment if brady and manning could scramble , they could . but they can ' t . if you can move the ball and destroy defenses like alabama , then you should be able to play the way you want . nfl head coaches should be smart enough to design offenses to take advantage of players strengths we saw how successful rgiii was his rookie year since shanahan was able to incorporate his running into an effective offense running gives defenses something else to worry about , and it actually can simplify throwing . if teams hace to devote a spy to you theoretically , that ' s one less defender in coverage . but na . nfl coaches can ' t be expected to think outside the box or be held responsible while everybody falls in love with the trubiskys of the world cuz they have a nice pro day , while no one mentions he ' s older he ' s older than watson , yet couldn ' t start at north carolina . he kinda reminds me of jake locker who had all the physical traits

plus the kitty is super cool & none of my mains would run with him as main comp . only narell could . 😊 i ' m always torn because class companions gain influence quicker via conversations but i want to quest with creatures sometimes . no win i had a lot of blue and green scraps , so fed the kitty almost gifts . he ' s infl . now . yeah i ' ve been grateful to command crates for the jawa junk . keep meaning to do conquest , but i forget <annoyed> yeah , i ' ve kept an eye on conquest for the last few weeks but been unable to do any bc for some reason they ' ve had zero or few heroics ! ! 😠 yeah a few recently have involved a lot of uprisings or other group stuff that i never do . <annoyed> i ' m not very good at group ! group stuff stresses me out so it ' s rare for stars to align & ) i want to do it ) people are available ) it gets me something in - game lol usually when i log in i find myself alone in guild ! 😂 but if i log in on tre at what is the middle of the night in europe i expect that ! depends what ' middle of the night is ' . i ' m finding pub side is rarely populated with guildies on tre and shadowlands nowadays . i was on ebon hawk from until midnight yesterday , usually peak , but at one point only people on the fleet ! thought i was on tre
and then obama said : if you like your doc you can keep your doc insurance companies had different plans . precisely why we need single payer universal healthcare . single payer doesn ' t lower costs and leads to rationing . months to get mri in canada and u.k. look at va for glimpse of future that ' s not what i hear from relatives in both places . i ' ve waited three months here to see a specialist , with a ppo . it ' s either not for urgent reasons or you have wrong ppo it ' s actually quite common . many i know , with varied health plans , wait . free market competition only way to drive down prices and improve care . govt involvement creates bureaucratic layers and one size fits all . someone has only had level economics pretty sure he hasn ' t had any . they cover bargaining power in intro to economic ​ s . well if you mean the socialist economics taught today then you ' d be right . if you want to see what single payer will look like see th va
and is still an acceptable age gap . it ' s the same thing as a senior dating a sophomore or freshman . a tad odd , but not unusual years is an acceptable gap but someone being and at the time is different , obviously . that really is not
be proud of labour ' s record on economic credibility . don ' t let the tories or their press away with saying otherwise . this is a muddled message . is national debt , deficit good or bad ? is a gov surplus good or bad ? agree tories not credible . according to tories , they wanted to remove deficit & debt so as not to burden the next generation - failed spectacularly on both counts ! ! next generation is being failed by the running down of nhs & infrastructure etc . poor economics is the cause , it shld be clearly exposed .

so basically what i ' m saying is i had a near death encounter with a fearsome ghost . … i was just walking up the stairway , at the back of the building , all alone and the lights started flickering hardcore . the beast 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 nah man he ' s only coming after you ! ! 😂 😈 no he isnt omg 😭 😭 😭 i check twice everyday 😂 maybe it was my boy casper too . maybe him and the beast are friends 😂 i hope not . humans are one thing but killing doggies is too far <annoyed> i still havent seen proof of this 😂 he looks pretty friendly and protective of a dog here 😂
and maybe you need to look at the contracts he inherited - and dealt for dimes on dollar - that were expiring . jr , iman , tyson , melo , etc . c ' mon you guys said jr was untradeable , felton ' s gun charge , chandler quit . . tbh he made rookie mistakes by not being more patient having a coach get more out of them was the move . . . . which the cavs did . coach ? you mean lebron got more from them in lesser roles , which says more abt melo not leading & getting more out of his buddies yes , melo is not lebron . . . along with every other player in the nba . so phil is doing a great job . you win . he ' s not doing a great job , it ' s incomplete at best , below act at worst . i just don ' t want dolan / caa / melo / thomas running the team again of course it might be nice to actually bring in someone with a real plan . like i advocated for when phil got hired . kp , willy , kuz even koq are examples of poor talent ? do we have to do this . . . he fell to 4 th , kudos for picking kp , not hezonja or someone else , but he loved okafor . kuz - yr old marginal nba fell to 4 th ? you guys laughed at the pick ! most experts wanted mudiay , winslow or wcs . . c ' mon man you ' re better than that

despite some people insisting otherwise . the freemaker adventures are canon . . . sort of . i like how the creators have dubbed it : " canon paraphrase . " as in canon at its source , but not in its telling . i just think it ' s funny that so many people can ' t figure this out and be okay with it . there are more options than " canon " or " not canon " i ' ve heard it mentioned as " canon adjacent , " and described as being its own canon , but not being canon as far as the rest of sw is concerned yeah that ' s not confusing at all canon adjacent : characters , locations , events from canon are true on the timeline ; however , other elements are brought in the lego universe . the creators of the show have even said it ' s not canon : … they then go on to say that it ' s like a child relating a canon story . which is exactly what i ' ve been saying . the way i ' ve always taken their statements is that the canon events are being retold by a child , who ' s adding his own things to it .

all over this country i ' ve talked to young people who have given up the dream of going to college because it ’ s too expensive . unacceptable ! a college education is a poor financial investment . you are wiser to go to a vocational school to learn a marketable skill . so we should give up what we ' re good at and do something we don ' t want to just to get a skill that may or may not land a job ? i have a degree from a top rated school with no debt . i ' m jealous of no one . you are jealous of what you don ' t have . put forth some effort . what makes you think i ' m not ? because i have well over the average in debt ? or because i feel education should be a right , not a cash cow ? it is already a right . you have the freedom to research any topic on your own . what is more important , the education or the certificate ? that certificate is equivalent to what a high school diploma was for past generations . can barely get a decent job without it . you want public funds to go to fulfilling a private market requirement ? how fortunate for them that they won ' t have train their employees .

' do people in france realise the bbc is state control and uses tory propaganda or do they think it ' s free thinking like some brain dead in uk the french are very disappointed with the bbc . they remember when it was state owned , but not state run . yes sadly state owned and run now . we were once proud of the bbc it was a showcase of free thinking but that ' s long gone . the french loved the bbc because of the war and its hand in d - day - that love affair lasted a long time . . . almost entirely dead , now . from inside it seems we r alienating the rest of europe with our billy big britches attitude 2 europe . the right / far right with loudest voice frankly , from the outside looking in , that ' s exactly how it looks - the french ( and german friends i know ) think the british have lost it .

what would change if coffee was red instead of black ? the black color of coffee is largely due to melanoidins which are formed in the roasting process ( which also degrades proteins / sugars ) so the first rule perhaps would be that coffee would have to be unroasted / " green " and hence taste very different : woody / herbal like a tea red color at an acidic ph ( like coffee ' s ) is characteristic of anthocyanins such as those in red wine . this would lend an astringent taste someones studying hard i can see . but my question was , if only coffee ' s color was different ( optical ) , how would we react to it .

disagree . it took democrats a yr , and it almost failed multiple times . neither gop or trump have stomach & political courage to repeal it gonna chip away at it in bits chipping away without passing legislation will have same effect as obama environmental stuff , it ' s not long lasting in a real way once gop agreed universal coverage has to be achieved , the fight was lost . single payer will be here in a decade . i ' m resigned to it well hillary clinton says " never ever " so . . . here ' s dirty secret about trump hardcore support : crave security over everyting single payer is something they really like if pitched right yeah but don ' t a lot of them vote against their own interests time and again ? the ' they vote against their self interest ' trope is dumb . as if voting is simply ' what gov benefits will my vote acquire ' is only measure i think saying " what benefits they can acquire " is too narrow . voting for folks that post ill - qualified people in power is playing yourself . i think trump is unique case though , he campaigned as populist but let ' s establishment gop & bannon run things . so people are like wtf ?

recognize that women owe you nothing and are not the magic tunnel to emotional intelligence and self - esteem . recognize that basically nothing and no one can make you feel better about yourself if you don ' t do the work first . anyway . i am going to eat lunch . i love you . don ' t be awful . it ' s possible . i know many people raised in toxic masculinity who do not awful . no , one more thing . that unthinkpiece is so demeaning about men friendships and you deserve better friendship from each other , my mens . be kind . talk about things . have pillowfights at slumber parties .

mastodon sounds good in principle but people asking others not to post about trump is some real silly nonsense is this a real thing ? like , do i need to figure out how to sign up for an account ? or is this peach ? ehh its not quite peach , there ' s a motherboard piece about it today and the ui is basically tweetdeck … but also i just think twitter is too entrenched for something this specialized to compete with in the long run bummer . this website is getting so bad that it feels like being “ twitter but not twitter ” could be a viable product .

when will trump ' s supporters abandon him ? … i already did abandon him when i heard about his repeal on internet privacy , now anyone can buy your personal info i ' m surprised the left is too busy talking about russia instead of the actual threat to everyone ' s privacy . . . that ' s being talked about too . a lot , but we can ' t impeach him or his admin for that . sure you can , the government is supposed to protect its citizens from danger , and now he just let anyone black mail anyone they want .

i 💑 brian , but ( at least out of context ) this sounds like a very typically blockchain - y failure to comprehend what law , as a system , does . … blockchain is going to completely overhaul law , resulting in new hybrid human and algorithmic systems the legal system wraps a layer of abstraction around private contracts . blockchain may refine ( perhaps even transform ? ) that component .
the first invincible movie has to be the first issues , right ? i mean , it ' s gotta climax *snicker* with the throw down with his dad . that ' s the scary question . do they go in with the idea of a franchise or trying to squeeze it all in to a super sized or parter . that ' s the curious part for sure , open ended would be great , make mark the superhero james bond with no end in sight . since the title is coming to a conclusion there is quite literally an end in sight . the book only has more issues . the end of all things definitely , but it would be cool if it took them movies to get there . 😊 if only we were that lucky . so where ' s the year old actor that ' s ready to play mark grayson for the next years ? invincible ha ! exactly . plus , kirkman certainly doesn ' t mind changes when his work gets adapted , so it might be a real surprise to see what happens .

based on reddit / twitter , there were a lot of folks interested in this game that won ' t get it without seeing non - pr produced gameplay . i mean theres already plenty on non - pr gameplay out there , let alone the block is after / and the game starts in april sure , but people are clearly upset for valid reasons , shouldn ' t that be all you need to see why this is regressive behaviour ? imo its just people being mad that theyre being told no , like this isnt even the first time atlus did this it ' s more like " we thought you ' d have learned by now " considering the way modern marketing for games has changed i think its more on the japanese way wanting people to enjoy it for themselves and not through someone else sounds like their way is outdated then . they ' re entitled not to change their stance anyway but people ' s complaints are understandable . from a story maker side is it outdated ? like its nothing irregular out of normal advertising and marketing , and its not like face value content is blocked , just dont show story important stuff , bosses , and anything passed / , its not like theres nothing to show in the time we live in , it ' s outdated to control the way a piece of media is consumed . regardless of how little or how much .

wow , uh , okay . i guess i ' m not streaming persona . that ' s pretty fucking stupid . too many restrictions to make it worth streaming . … here ' s a note in regards to streaming persona . … the restrictions are : can ' t show major story beats , can ' t show ' mostly conversations ' , can ' t stream past ingame calendar date / . aka the actual interesting stuff in the game . the combat is the means to an end , to get to the interesting conversations and story beats . i ' m not entirely sure how legal that is . considering this would apply to anyone who buys the game after release . none of them signed an nda it could be in the tos . but as far as streaming it is concerned , i don ' t know whether it would hold up or not yeah , but if is tweeting about it , clearly altus is willing to be a dick about it . i didn ' t see twitch support ' s tweet . just the retweets from the company statement . i wonder what ' s gonna happen to all the people that break the rules

there is no obama surveillance scandal even when you capitalize the words . … when will sleepy eyes chuck todd and start talking about the obama surveillance scandal and stop with the fake trump / russia story ? you can keep saying that ben . but no matter how many times you do . the paperwork doesn ' t lie . only the democrats step ) say russia all day long , step ) say there was no surveillance scandal . step ) repeat steps + until non - democrats believe them i haven ' t seen any proof of either , but there is enough smoke in the rus story that there may be a fire . yet there ' s lots of proof of unlawful dissemination of info and unmasking in the surveillance . it bothers me that many are more concerned with how things are known than the substance of the claims .
lol i vote . i vote for people who work within the constitution . not selling us to russia . you decry socialism not me . your values skewed hillary eas the one who sold out to the russians . yes phyllis hillary tried to lift russian sanctions and cancelled military aid to ukraine . no wait ! that was trump . and manafort manafort was in the trump campaign for about two weeks i think that hardly makes him a good example . lol he was w trump for a couple of years . he was in charge for months he lived in trum tower and laundered money . for janusevich and other but meanwhile since you ' re a socialist you must want free college and i really want to go back to college to get a phd so can you pay ? free , yeah . and when we run out of other people ' s ( taxpayer ' s ) money ? what are people thinking ? oh , right . they ' re not . of course you ' re right they are more than willing to spend your and my money and the grind their political socialist agenda i am still reeling from the hateful insanity consuming the us and the world . radical politics / religious fervor , bad combo for humanity . i agree on that % trump is lying to us . like venezuela

there are hundreds of other parts of a game , with dramatically larger budgets , that can be part of that conversation . games already ship with bugs , cut content , lack polish , die from a thousand cuts . is choosing you gender in doom really important , really ? many devs got into this to make games fun , not to affirm every marginalized group out there . they work long overtime , take paycuts , etc . etc if they go out of their way to make those changes then awesome ! but sometimes you can just be a guy that shoots demons in the face . not sometimes . almost every time . it ' s very rare to be able to play a lady , especially in action games and shooters . that even it being an option rates so low on the list of priorities that you feel it shouldn ' t normally make the cut speaks volumes . maybe consider that marginalized folks also get into games to have fun , and that if it ' s comparatively cheap to enable that , we should . again , easy to say , but i ' ll just let a recent tweet explain it best : … pre - gamedev : " why don ' t devs spend more time polishing their games " post - gamedev : " it is a miracle literally any game ever ships " i ' m gonna be dead clear with you : i ' m with zandra on this one . the easiest way to have female protags is to plan it from day . pretty much what zandra said 👌 you can decide that gender and inclusion is important from day then plan for it . not hard .

rep . joaquin castro on the russia investigation : i wouldn ' t be surprised if some trump associates end up in jail wha ? ? ? how about susan rice and the leakers - - felony jail time . rice gate she leaked nothing , she did her job trying to figure out what the hell trump ' s up to with russia . and we ' ve yet to discover who leaked . how can you say she isn ' t the leak ? we don ' t know yet . the president himself started this w / his tweet that he was wietapped . this is a conspiracy to divert our attn from the russia investigation . he obviously was surveilled - fact ! his campaign was surveilled b / c they were talking with russians who were being surveilled . it ' s called incidental surveillance . rhetoric . rhetoric . rhetoric . no proof . show me evidence . otherwise you speculate & assume . so even if talked - ok to unmask & leak ? ? biased
the movie may have stunk ( or could have been good and fans overreacted to expectations ) but junichi hayama ' s jojo designs are still my fav . …
i ' d like to know from someone who watches russ every game , does he stat chase ? this seems like territory .
this is man who was just profusely praised by - a bigot and white supremacist . trump says he deserves a pulitzer . really . he started pizza gate . he ' s a degenerate . he ' s also ready to pop the next big story 😀 . . . who leaked the names to the nyt . . . such an incestuous relationship . . . progressives / left and msm . .

spot on . i would have taken romo over - guys every year but he shouldn ' t be remembered as top of his era … he was a good qb for his time . not great , but definitely better than two thirds of the league ' s qbs . fun to watch . rodgers , peyton , brees , brady , ben , rivers and eli before romo hands down . no way you put rivers or eli before romo . . . . eli has the same number of rings as romo has playoff wins sabermetrics so i guess sanchez and dilfer are better than romo also ? difference is eli and romo are relatively close in stats , eli ' s playoff performance puts him a step above have you seen romos playoff performances ? they are incredible , but it takes more than one guy to win a game . . . the way players ( quarterbacks ) are judged is by results , fair or not is another argument entirely

watch how most of the rebounds that he caught are just his teammates allowing him to when there ' s no competition they block out for him . if he couldn ' t get it , do you think they wouldn ' t ? this is coming out from someone who watches every nba team . . . . . lol his teammates arent shitty westbrook made them look shitty when they lost are you kidding right now ? ? ? well that explains the amount of losses thunder had this year ? ? ? westbrook not getting his 1 0 ast and rebounds . thunder can not win without him . rockets have won without harden lol please westbrook had not missed a game what makes your point valid ? won against the suns . . . ? okay . . . . . . . you think the thunder could win without westbrook ? point given if it has always been a team without westbrook , they would win a few games . now that everyone on the team expects westbrook to do crazy shit and he does that crazy shit

i think if all of us were approaching you as someone to be fixed , or a problem to be solved , we ' d be doing it wrong we just want to offer you support and be friends that you can lean on when things are tough , even if that means you need to lean on us a lot you ' re not doing that to me because i ' m choosing it myself and it ' s not going to make me fed up with you , it might tire me but it ' s not like that ' s something i haven ' t dealt with before or won ' t ever have to deal with again that in turn just means i need to rely on others myself no one is worth the effort but that doesn ' t mean i just pack up my bags and say " well it ' s not worth my time to invest in others " what a miserable existence that would be but there ' s value in the kindness and compassion i can offer others , not for my own sake but for those in my life that i can choose to share that with i have no reason to exclude you from that when i ( rightly ) consider you an equal

- allowed their creatives complete and total control , ( except a few things , / occurred and they had to cut out a bunch of violence ) and - - treasure planet is what resulted . you put the greatest talent , the biggest budget , and the highest tech in one spot , and no , you don ' t - - get the crowd - pleasing easily digestible safe happy minimally tearful romp you think you ' re getting , you get an emotionally complex film - - with no fixed morality viewpoint and like with all sci - fi , you trust your audience to understand the universe rules instead of going - - " huh ? " every five minutes . this is why fantasy and scifi is often niche , because you have to allow yourself to trust it , instead of it - - being spoonfed to you , and ultimately i think this kind of risk - taking imaginative thing is what animation was created to portray i think of windsor mccay and how he turned comics from gag comics in sunday papers to a longform graphic novel format and changed everything you could never make treasure planet a live action film , only animation and animators could impart what that film did , thematically at this point i could go into the more writing and characterization side of why i love it but i don ' t think you ' re still reading this , so i ' ll summarize : treasure planet is the result of almost a century previous of animation talent development up until that moment . there u go

if you knew anything about how a fast break starts , you ' d see why they let him grab the rebound . who else would you want leading the break ? ! ball moves faster than the player . letting him grab the board is counterproductive for the break out of of westbrooks rebounds are uncontested boards from not playing defense , and he leaves his man open of the time lol does harden play defense ? ! nah , but everyone ' s so quick to say he ' s a better mvp choice . there is this thing called help defense tho . . . harden has a better defensive rating , offensive rating , + / - , better record , lower usage , and only less ppg and less rpg than russ maybe if he was used as much as westbrook is , those stats wouldn ' t be better . if harden had these pcs around him , okc isn ' t in the playoffs do you watch games ? harden runs the entire team the whole game . westbrook just isn ' t a playmaker or a good team leader

there ' s a marketing lesson to be learned from pepsi ' s tone - deaf ad : " message depends on context . " the intended message was " pepsi drinkers are generous people who make the world better , " with the obvious call - to - action of " drink pepsi . " the received message was " pepsi wants to capitalize on our pain , " and the call to action became " screw pepsi . definitely don ' t drink it . " neither message is accurate . pepsi drinkers are no different than other people , and pepsi is no different than other bigfood corps . i think the second message is accurate ? pepsi made a decision to use legitimate protest to make their drink ' cool ' .

2 a . miss leading its inaccurate . do you realize how caucasian you sound ? you sound like a white person under a blm message . take his words with a grain of salt . because the statement is completely false and based off an pure opinion it ' s really not . men know that men can be shitty . and they unconsciously vindicate that all the time . i see it happen always . men are very shitty at times . . . but you ' re not man and saying men can ' t think of some other men as altruistic is false does it really have to be stated that this isn ' t referring to all men ? you are debating on that basis ? i thought it was obvious . but sating men cant think of other men as altruistic is false some men can ' t . i can ' t believe i actually had to clarify . it clearly doesn ' t mean all men . if it doesn ' t apply , leave it alone . and most men are trash because of it ?

umi knows what ' s up . and part of that is knowing the difference between anxiousness and an actual full blown panic attack . ( thread ) … let me correct this . none of the things mentioned here are symptoms / signs of an actual anxiety attack , aka panic attack . it aves - mins . … while i have generalised anxiety ( and clinical depression , and ocd ) , i ' ve only had full out panic attacks maybe twice in my life . thank you so much for sharing this ; ; i worry a lot that ppl might self - diagnose and in the process overdiagnose themselves in cognitive therapy , we had a term for that : catastrophizing , and it happened a lot to ppl who self - diagnose yup . i went through cbt . while it helped a little for small situations , it mostly didn ' t work for me . though having the terms > > > > is useful . i compartmentalise . but it mostly ends up with my logical self knowing that my anxious self is being illogical and > > > > getting really irritated . like i know it ' s all brain chemicals , and that helps remind me that it ' ll pass most of the time .
mine are open . guess you are one that just get lead around by the noise . where is the proof trump is bad . clinton caught in lies , obama spies there has been absolutely no proof in all of the investigations that keep happening - yet , the haters still can ' t accept that . . . it is sad . why do y ' all keep saying there is no proof when investigations are going and repubs are even saying it ' s smoke - - y ' all can ' t be that dumb many innocent and guilty people are investigated daily ; an investigation does not mean either . calling it " smoke " doesn ' t change anything . . . there is smoke that ' s why they are investigations - - flynn already snitching and carter paige will snitch next - - don ' t let them fool you too i ' m not the one being fooled ; i ' m the one waiting for actual evidence . <happy> 😂 😂 😂 me too - - that ' s my point - - we need to wait till the investigations are over before we say there is no proof agreed ! i said there is not proof " yet " - - i won ' t condemn trump or rice or anyone else without proof . until then , it is all propaganda . <happy> no fox news is propaganda - - investigations are real so it can ' t be misleading propaganda : biased information used to promote a particular political point of view ; aka convicting without proof because it fits a narrative

you got rich + famous castigating usg over bosnia , et al , then oversaw far worse in syria . how dare you play innocent . … backed by russia & iran , declared permanent by trump , assad regime in syria feels safe to do what it wants . gassing people is what it wants . yes , thank you ! this wmd attack is on the obama admin . he fell for ru ' s " assad promises he ' ll never do it again . honest !

reading ' s twitter discussion on representation in romances is interesting , mainly due to my long exposure to the subject . i ' ve tried several approaches , and it eventually came to this : there is no " representation " switch you can flip which makes everyone happy . some folks want every romance bisexual , while others feel this leads to " playersexuality " and deprives the characters of agency . some folks want " real " sexualities , but others end up unhappy with their options or want every sexuality equally represented . others put the emphasis on how they ' re portrayed - minority chars must be morally perfect and written by someone who identifies as the same . so if your sole reason for putting representation into a game is to " make the social justice people happy " . . . well , good luck with that . thing is , there are better reasons to do it , and no good reason not to make the effort - even if there ' s *also* pressure to do exactly that . in the end , i fall on the " don ' t put the cart before the horse " side . characters are paramount . but variety makes for better characters .

if i owned a home in toronto , i would sell it now . the housing prices are ridiculous . bubble ridiculous . tempting , but we ' d have to move quite far to be able to buy anything else .

breaking : tillerson calls on russia , iran to make sure syria ' s assad doesn ' t launch chemical weapons attacks . sounds like america is no longer the respected and powerful country we once were if we have to go asking these countries to do our job no , it ' s because russia and iran are fighting with and aiding assad , not against . they have more leverage in this at the moment . i ' m sure begging him to " cut it out " will totally work regardless , it ' s obvious why he has to say it . its obvious he bloody caused it . . i mean its obvious to some i suppose my tweet was about rex . i don ' t defend trump ' s words , but this isn ' t a new revelation from him + attacks since . …

the farthest right person to counter my taxation tweets would be - the rest are just dancing around . farright : the entire concept of taxation ( especially on income ) is bogus . return to caste guilds with security for all and decentralize the rest have poorly developed arguments , half driven by spite and the other half by ignorance . tax is the execution of a social contract that exists between an individual and the state . a quid pro quid arrangement . tax policy and quantum is not a one sided thing . it results from constant bargaining between the state and the people . tax is thus the cost of building a social structure , and has to been distributed wherever the structure is weak . by extension , a nation is a social contract . this is at least what logic and even the theory states . we should encourage a greater % to go to state and local level taxes perhaps ? eg us school system runs on local taxes and accountability .

so this just happened . it ' s super weird to be tenured again , yrs after tenuring at msu . so , here ' s a little thread on why it ' s weird . i was first hired at msu as a full - time instructor . then , dr . z created a tenure - track faculty line for me . my strength was always teaching . that was my love , too . i made myself do research because i was at an r1 , but i never liked it because of the pressure . nothing felt good enough . i only liked it when i was working on research projects with students . because that felt like teaching . first time i went up for p & t i was turned down . too much service that didn ' t count , good teaching that also didn ' t count , not enough pubs . so i renegotiated my service duties to reduce them . i missed it , though . i liked service . then i went up again and was promoted / tenured . but the day i got my letter in , i knew i ' d never even try to go for full . i ' d end up miserable doing all that research . a year later i moved into full - time administration & did that for years . loved it . no research , it felt like service , still got to teach .

amazon has signed a deal to stream nfl games . … ( /) so it ' s clear that amazon / netflix / twitter / facebook are now in a war with the broadcast networks for sports too . importantly , twitter with ncaa bb ( & w / the nfl ) showed that it can create a better experience by tying in the rest of the social platform . so instead of waiting for fox , cbs , espn to create online platforms like espn3 , amazon enters the business and destroys the business model . and why should they wait ? the existing platforms for streamed sports really suck . streamed sports are * at best * . but is only great because it recreates the broadcast experience . streamed sports have the ability to change the way we watch sports by bringing increased interactivity and choice . so amazon enters and runs their playbook : heavily subsidize entry to new market , add to the platform , change the way people consume . nfl and ncaa bb were experiments for twitter , also shown on broadcast . what ' s the first big contract that comes up will be " streamed " only ?

queer question : we agree that polyam is cool for polyamorous , but would people understand polygen is short for polygender ? i don ' t think i would assume polygen means polygender . didn ' t think so . i ' ll just write it out if i have any characters id as so later . i do have polysexual and polyamorous characters now . 😟 so i know people use polyam but i honestly spell out polyamorous or polyamory even tho its longer . it feels more clear to me . i do have other associations w / polyam , which is part of it , but also i think new abbreviations are often hard for me & others w / brain fog . so , i ' ve stopped using poly to mean polyamorous but my brain doesn ' t find it easy to switch to a new abbreviation for it , so i just don ' t . i figure i ' m likely not alone in this , esp in my readership , so even tho it makes things more formal & long in text , i just go w / it anyway . i agree . and poly for polyamorous is offensive to polynesian peoples , which is why trying to keep on top of the correct terms . yup , thats why i stopped using it too .

yeah , but this argument is dangerously close to " for exposure " arguments saying do work for free so eventually you can profit ' someday ' yeaaaaaaah , but at the same time , i can ' t help but think i ' d be slapping " i made a game that got a million views and positive press " on a cv and then your next game is also streamed well and makes no money do you take down streams before it launches if your fear is theirs ? maybe even make a version with a cliffhanger to give to lpera for free that way they can promote it and have their video this is the absolute closest i can think of to " having cake and eating it too . " i ' m kind of confused that you ' re so ok w / not making money though , not profiting will destroy any career + hobbies never have as much effort mmm i ' m not okay with it is the thing , it ' s just a thing that happened . there is value to their story and in a perfect world , they ' d be paid however , they gotta work with the system if this is the type of game they want . not against it . clearly taking things down didn ' t help . it ' s complicated bc maybe they dont need to work w the system streamers obv say they added value dev worried they actually didn ' t proof ? okay so , this is something i can contest . if i were to tell you , " i can get . 5 m people to see your game , " isn ' t that also marketing value ?

so you are putting doctors in a high risk situation that their careers are even bigger jeopardy . people sue doctors for trivial things all the time in america . this will just cripple doctors being able to defend themselves . what will " cripple doctors being able to defend themselves " ? are we removing liability insurance & courts ? ? what slippery slope are you on ? so you have no idea how the malpractice courts are handled out . if it is a right then a doctor must do what the patient want moron . and what does that right entail exactly ? does it mean that they have the right to a specific doctor to operate on them ? universal health care means universal access . not universal outcomes . only simpletons would think otherwise . then what is the point of having mdicaid for all ? so you want to pay for expensive healthcare with shitty results ? ? ? you are a fool your assumptions about results are based upon what ? where is " competition " stifled ? do you know how medicaid payments work under the aca ? and how shitty it is , is something you ignore , kek competition between the states you dolt . like how canada wanted to sell us cheap drugs . so in order to survive , insurance companies will have to lower costs to compete .

thinking there is any settled science is to misunderstand how science works . there are settled rules of logic , however . let ' s stick to them . unfortunately that ' d only serve pay lip service each other & not deal w / the reality of what ' s going on around the world on this subject you are seriously telling me that you think scientists are not focused on the reality ? by & large yes they try to be as logical & honest in their quest for answers ​ . the output of fossil fuel pr depts is deliberately easy to understand & process science does not have this advantage in vying for acceptance which do u think causes more damage the earth , fracking or the or so massive dams that cause ' s of earthquakes each day ? careful there is also in this question an assumption that correlation equals causation . are u suggesting the massive hydro - dams don ' t cause earthquakes ? now you are continuing the habit of moving to another opinion without having validated previous ones . i ' m trying understand the meaning of ur prior tweet so i may respond appropriately . its an honest question to u to avoid misinterpretation

yes it ’ s not even a question . favre by miles and miles . okay , unrelated but on my mind : now let ' s talk about how the falcons need a legarrette blount type , we could have won the superbow if we had if the falcons had legarrette blount , they ’ d never use him . he ’ s not good enough to keep freeman / coleman off the field . need a - man roster go back and look at week saints vs falcons it was another point collapse in the making but atlanta pulled out the win with a pick if falcons have a - man roster and a salary cap , a third - down specialist makes sense . for that roster ? defense a much bigger issue . i ' m not saying freeman and coleman are bad running backs but they do have weaknesses and bringing in a 3 rd guy would help . i have the data sure . but he doesn ’ t play special teams . you need a bigger roster if you bring in niche players for a tiny role . run on third and short . y ' alls pod got me motivated af . i ' m writing an article on this very topic because i ' d love to work at nfln i get what you ’ re saying . i just think a third - down running specialist is low on the list of issues . defense , as a whole , much bigger .

so we should never play kompany ? stones was quality . like i said , willy and fern let us down tonight with errors massively unconvinced with js . huge liability in so many areas . massive misses tonight to . and no , he should have replaced vk in aug . stones can ' t head the ball in attacking or defensive positions , absolute dog shite under pressure and can ' t finish . he ' s a cb , why you judging his finishing ? aguero has missed plenty recently just pointing out he can ' t do anything . paid for his ability to use his feet ! defended solidly again tonight , price isn ' t decided by him . he ' s still a kid and a very good one when you pay you expect to get a relatively decent player straight away with a road to improvement , he ' s shite . ok explain why when we ' re losing pep waits till minute to change it ? not enough time for the player coming on to make any impact . did you actually watch the match ? sterling came on earlier . give it a rest

heavy face watchers in conversation i see , that ' s an interesting element of the story that isn ' t generally expressed . which i guess is part of the course for issues that are both big and very very personal . my reasoning for thinking schools should have a religions of the world type approach is based in that though - to help us all understand eachother better . so having a non - affiliated framework with guests from various denominations . it ' s *difficult* to understand others when you don ' t know about them . it ' s also wrong to feel like what applies to minorities - applies to you as well , even if you ' re the minority ( say , muslims / catholics in france ) . so if you ' re a public school teacher you can ' t wear a t - shirt that says anything about how christ is awesome , just like a muslim can ' t wear a niqab . small items like a pendant are ok ( cross , fatima ' s hand , david ' s star . . . ) but that ' s all . for all . in nz i don ' t think that would work because a niqab for example is cultural as much as it is religious . for māori the equivalent is . . . not being allowed to work in certain roles if you have a traditional tattoo .

i like that . every friend i have also is protrump , live in bible belt . they are going to need help dealing w / betrayal . they are good people who made bad decision . mostly based on and their religious leaders for public stance on abortion . - sigh - i believe that is the number one reason a lot if people voted for him also . i think it should be banned as a political topic . i agree totally . each person has the right to their own convictions . and legislate pro - choice , and then let churches preach as they choose it ' s twisted win votes . example : pp doesn ' t get govt funding for abortions . the hyde amendment restricts that , but most voters don ' t know . many people who voted him cos of the abortion issue think that dems r pro abortion . def not the case . pro choice doesn ' t = pro abortion . uhh . . . thats exactly what it means so , whether someone chooses to have an abortion , or chooses not to have an abortion , they are pro - abortion ? if i say robbing bank is bad but i support your choice its a deflection you can ' t compare bank robbery to a person ' s medical choice . it ' s none of my fucking business if you choose due to rape , incest , illness , etc

do u even know what the definition of " miracle " is ? now , why do you want to infect others with the hopelessness and meaninglessness that is within you ? straw man argument again . also - ur religion is true because it provides hope & meaning ? so does islam . or a competitive sport . or a donut . you mean competitive sports where athletes kneel , pray , & praise god and atheists sue them for it ? you should crawl out from under your rock once in a while . …

i understand your point ( and also i ' m not defending dogs being eaten or killed ) but that ' s sort of the problem isn ' t it ? people really want to be able to justify their actions and still have something to be angry about . we think we get to determine what lives are worth more than others . dogs are pets here so we think it ' s wrong for anyone to consume them . but the hypocrisy is the issue as someone who cares deeply for animals altogether , not just one species , i think it ' s important that all of us look at ourselves before we start attacking other cultures . if you think eating a dog is wrong because they are loyal , sweet , loving , and gentle , and don ' t think the same way about cows or pigs or chickens , etc , that attitude is adding to the apathy our country has as a whole when it comes to the treatment of animals that our country consumes . they are lives too . they have feelings . they ' re capable of love i just think that until we look at how we treat our own animals we have no business getting angry about how another country treats theirs unless we ' re advocating for all of the animals . not just dogs , and not just because they ' re dogs i agree with you , i just think you need to try and see it from their eyes . they ' re on your side of the fence , so i ' d think it best to

the media have built an illogical narrative based on no evidence and only focused on outcome : regime change in syria . journalism is telling stories and events as they happen , not determining event a priori and then building stories to produce imagined event . to have the latest allegation of cw attack by syria gov in khan sheikhoun in context we have to go back to … language of un briefing on khan sheikhoun : ' if confirmed ' ' reportedly ' ' means could not be confirmed ' fact finding is task of opcw given the above , one may think members sitting at unsc would work toward confirming reports & fact finding . but no . … what ensued was an avalanche of invectives from us , uk & france targeting assad , syria gov , russia , and the un . not mentioned in your misleading mainstream media : khan seikhoun is a core al qaeda stronghold . … maybe this propaganda might have escaped your vigilance , because of the images of dead children ? … al qaeda ' s use of prime time coverage of alleged khan sheikhoun cw attack for propaganda : ' islam rules everything ' & ' you should do jihad ' ' all circumstances , on all fronts , military , political , and international , work against assad if he uses cw .

she was made the face of the advert when she had no say in the creation . therefore she deserves an apology . we shouldn ' t assume anything she ' s literally one of the highest paid models / actresses currently going , it would have been extremely easy to back out of it that ' s true , she ' s capable of making her own decisions but the fact remains that they are apologising that she is the face of the hate i agree she shouldn ' t get the hate , but that advert was absolutely ridiculous and she should have known better i can ' t wrap my head around the fact that anyone thought that advert was in the slightest okay no privileged white bitch pulling this shit deserves an apology idgaf . it ' s vile . whether she ' s privlaged or not makes no difference . she ' s a person who is getting hate for something out of her control . but it won ' t affect anything in her life , sure it might be a bit annoying / vaguely upsetting but it won ' t harm her career or anything that ' s true but the hate towards her is unjustified . she did not create the ad she merely acted in it exactly . either she has no say on important issues ( ignorant ) or she didn ' t speak up about them ( pathetic )

rock on maxine . we have your back ! i love maxine . the dems are fighting back . no one can wither an opponent with a look like ms . waters . so agree with you . look what we accomplished with over advertisers pulling out of the show . he ' s a disgrace and must he fired resist why aren ' t we doing this with fox , in general ? it works ! we absolutely should ! but there needs to be a scandal attached does anyone have the emotional strength to watch one of their shows ? i would , but i think i ' d have a stroke within the first few minutes . i can ' t beyond the first five minutes . i want to barf we need someone with a strong stomach to watch and write down the sponsors for each show . sure to hear something offensive , start tweeting ! the retards at have been doing that for years , and their ratings only get better . oh , you watch fox ? all those ads . all directed at the old folks .

if they want to partake in the table , yeah … question ; if you decide for your birthday that you wanna get a table , do you ask your friends to put up ? but it ' s something you want to do . it ' s not their idea so why would you make them pay ? it ' s not a ' make ' thing . it ' s about approach . if you offer it as an idea some people may be wit it . if they offer to help that ' s one thing . but saying if you come , you have to pay that ' s corny .
its an incorrect assumption you are repeatedly making . a lion who hunts and eats its prey doesn ' t assume it is superior or invincible . and i already told you how the native indians do not consider themselves superior to the animals they hunt . infact they revere / worship them . abrahmism is quite deeply rooted in our modern society , therefore its easy to make such assumptions about others . doesn ' t make it right non - argument . every theology rationalizes animal slaughter in different ways . even hindus . doesn ' t make one superior . hindus don ' t rationalize animal slaughter . in fact the act of eating meat pulls you down in the spiritual evolution chain do not agree at all . but ) ahimsa is first yama in raja yoga ) not allowed in bhakti yoga ( check even kabir ) ) all creatures are part of god , gyan yoga only in karma yoga can meat eating be less damaging . even a butcher can attain salvation as in mahabharat instance of vyadha gita too complex a concept for most to understand . you ' re right . eating meat for sustenance , fine . but when you do it for taste then it pulls you down . double whammy . killing plus addiction

oh i don ' t have any good answers either . i ' m not sure there is a public policy solution . can policy change material conditions ? yes definitely can policy change thoughts and attitudes ? difficult to say what should we focus on ? 🤔 policy absolutely can change people ' s beliefs . the historical evidence for this is extensive . so yeah my official stance on this is absolutely yes it can , but not predictably and it can easily badly backfire . sure , nothing is fore - ordained . capitalism is really racial capitalism , though , and we ' ll never get anywhere against capital without dismantling racism . and i mean that as a precondition . it ' s not just a simultaneous struggle , imo , but that anti - racist resistance is a prior requirement i mean , historically , outside of russia , successful resistance to capitalism has only flourished in the formerly colonized world

russia will want keep their naval base and protect the alawis . and keep rebels out of power u really think that ? russia is not that powerful putin power resides mostly on incapacity of usa right now after iraq fuck up syria is different every muslim country hates assad unlike iraq / libya plus alawis are in minority the majority will support intervention if us attacks and there are russian casualties , they will strike back . putin won ' t let trump humilliate him if usa + uk + gulf + turkey send in their jet russia will withdraw i m sure of it & why russian causalities if usa will only strike syrian planes ur thoughts bro ? mate , i partially agree with your assessment , but putin wouldn ' t want to look weak domestically on this issue . plus , i doubt that there would be enough consensus usa , uk gulf & turkey to collaborate on this issue . esp . usa under president trump wouldn ' t intervene unless there ' s a lot of political pressure within america to do so . but if such a coalition is formed & the consensus is there , russia will probably reach an agreement on withdrawing collectively .

i thought there was no logic or pattern our system to the disbelief . why bring in the russell ' s tea cup argument ? because the onus of proof is on you ? no it ' s not . atheists are constantly shifting the burden . lazy ! atheists don ' t shift it , burden of proof never left the person making the claim , theists want to shift it because they cannot prove but saying ' god does not exist ' , that ' s a definite statement , therefore its a claim . so russell ' s teapot applies to you to so just as we have to prove god exists , you have to prove he doesn ' t . we both have to prove . agnostics don ' t bear this burden however no , you are making the claim , i simply don ' t believe it . pretty sure it ' s easy to get and you in turn claim god doesn ' t exist also . so ? how many times can i type a simple definition lol . semantics the new problem lol . nothing to do with semantics chief

in fairness , i can understand why they cancelled the flights . this weather is some of the worst i ' ve ever seen here . train from mdt to bwi would be about hours w / xfer in philadelphia . maybe park there and overnight at bwi ? it doesn ' t really make sense . hours to take the train back to bwi , then another hours to drive ? <tong> plus the costs involved . hrm , raises good question . are you out of the $$ $ put up for the hotel / trip if flights cancelled , call the thing a wash , & try for home ? i ' m home now , so that ' s easy enough . i would probably get a refund from the airline , yeah . hotels differ but usually will refund given enough time . i think pulsar lost a deposit this time .

was this the same formation against psg ? … ibra sent off in d firsthalf but jm still instructed his players to defend for 9 0 min + extratime and rely on eden ' s brilliance vs 1 0 men psg lol . bro . eden is not better than what he is at chelsea , i will say it again and again . he ' s in a team and league where there are no world . . he is not better than what he is , what happened to suarez would he have won evrytin he won @ barca @ lpool u are so biased he didn ' t hitch a ride , he came to barca and contributed immensely to all the titles he ' s won . what is the bias you are talking about ? lol u said eden ain ' t better than what he is @ cfc . did suarez improve ? he came to barca off the back of a goal season without any penalties at liverpool and he was dont forget . had breakthrough games in cl , el clasico , outscored messi last season are all this shit not improvement lmfao am done he already had breakthrough games against all top opposition in epl and erevidise , i can bet you his shot to goal ratio didn ' t change . improvement means a change in his style of play or an upgrade . suarez is the exact same player from liverpool we only supplied more chances .

if we ' re on the same page that for some people , kink feels like a sexual orientation and is not a ' choice ' , i think we could focus on / the important ( historical , cultural , legal ) reasons why lgbtq + folks need ' queer ' to stay what it is . / and i ' d also like to have a solid discussion with these ppl about cishet people who are pan / bi when it comes to kink intimacy . heterosexual , heteroromantic people who like to experience kink intimacy with people of various genders . i know a few . i thought the rule was " i will listen to how you wish to identify and respect that , even if it doesn ' t match my personal definition . " i guess part of this is the idea that if you say " what makes you queer ? " , i have the right to say " none of your business ! "

people on the left are saying that gorsuch was further right than scalia with it . but i do understand it . what i ' m saying is the gop argument against garland was that obama was a lame duck pres trying to make a lasting legacy and there have been several dems saying they ' re against it because trump is under investigation . he is . the fbi is investigating . you may not like it but there ' s a reason that flynn was forced to step down . i don ' t know . the fact that trump is pushing so hard for flynn to get immunity makes me wonder if flynn is gonna fall on the sword for him .

if there ' s something wrong with this chain of reasoning , where is it ? you assume a steady state . it ' s not stable . it ' s always in flux within certain parameters based on orbit , atmosphere & ocean heat transfer . also sun ' s brightness , reflectiveness of earth . but over the next - years , atmosphere is the only factor which is changing rapidly . solar activity has dropped to nil . that changes far more frequently . temp goes along with it . just ask mr maunder . it ' s not the co2 , man . so you ' re thinking that recent rise in temperature is due to increase in solar energy ? … no , it ' s mainly due to the recent el nino . temperatures will eventually plummet to below those of the little ice age . interglacial ending . whoa , hold on . el nino redistributes energy within the system , can ' t add energy . if sun is stable , and co2 is up , then energy is up , no ? heat moves about . if it comes up out of the oceans , then troposphere heats up . if co2 is the control , then there would never be glaciations . . . . but if sun is stable , and co2 is up , then by conservation of energy , there *has* to be more energy in the system . right ? looking at energy , we have a system with one input ( solar energy ) and one output ( thermal radiation ) . there ' s nowhere for the energy to go .

u.s. weighs military options in response to syrian chemical attack . trump voters now regret their vote - but their vote is more like a tattoo than a one night stand . it will mark us forever . we ' re at war - thx !
one way to look at interiors : a further expression of your character , like clothing . what couch do they have ? what carpet ? kidlit art you can also look at environments from an emotional storytelling view . for instance , trying to make peaceful vs . angry shapes . kidlit art
no worries ! sit back , relax ! knows exactly what he ' s doing ! we trust his decisions and back him ! hes my president … syria hoax now we know its the wrong move ! don ' t do it ! ! ! ! ! … thank you lori !

is donald trump throwing us into a war with syria while he vacations on golf courses and his entire team is investigated for treason ? wow . hillary wanted strike though . not our president , not the actual issue at hand . try again .
military action done right ! potus … 🚨 breaking 🚨 the united states just launched tomahawk cruise missiles at targets in syria ordered by president trump . maga tcot fox news congrat potus acta non verba .
not that arent some obvious cases ( like ashfur needing to be in the dark forest ) ( ( he chose listen to hawk over protecting his leader ) ) but overall . . . . . there are really a lot of morally grey characters in warriors that . . . . get shoved into bad or evil after death i think the decision of good / evil should be portrayed more like loyalty to clan ways vs unloyalty . . .
obama bombed syria for years , yes . but important to differentiate that the strikes weren ' t aimed at assad . liberals are mad we ' re launching missiles , and conservatives are mad potus is abandoning isolationist - geared agenda .
[ checks phone after several hours talking to a human ] praying for our troops , syria ' s civilians & this fragile world we all share .
thank god we have a president who isn ' t weak , and isn ' t going to allow these in humane acts in syria and around the world
this time we put troops in harms way to attack a brutal despot slaughtering his citizens it ' ll be appreciated . 7 3 rd time ' s the charm syria
we bombed syria ? . . . . . ww3 ? ?
literally hours ago of liberals were going crazy demanding military action . … this is on your boy trump . so trump takes his advice from snowflakes now ? it ' s hard to believe he was genuinely duped . . . but democrats everywhere were pushing for this . there may be more to the story . guessing comet pizza staged that chemical attack casualties video in their backyard . more to the story
but y ' all this has been happening in syria forever . this isn ' t recent news . this war has been going on for such a long time .
what wmd ? none were found . you ' ve been at war for all but years of your country ' s existence and you ' re blaming everyone else ? there was no war from - . . . that ' s years right there . - , there ' s another not according to this . . . did you know the crg ( publishers of that chart ) was part of a campaign to slander jews and ukrainians ? they may not be the best source i agree ! i just like to fact check people , i think people should do their research before putting stuff out there i ' m anti usa as a country that bullies others for their own benefit . most american ' s that i deal with however are lovely people hey it ' s hard to be the big dog without ruffling some feathers usa usa usa
so , here ' s the thing : your feelings are real . they are valid .
and and people have been given a script by a lawyer for how to answer me so i look bad . is that okay ?
thanks so much for all the likes and rts ! 👍 ❤️ 🍀 😊 ✨ 🙏 ✨ thank you too , there ' s so many to thank

i ' ll be very interested re : reax . this is not a us flag - waving , defend - the - homeland event . will it strike chord w / voters ? … trump ' s approval is going to hit a post election high after this . the lesson he ' ll take from that is obvious and terrifying . half of his base is pissed because they were happy about not being the " world police " .
us defense officials tell that the us military did contact russians in advance of the strikes . so . . basically , you put big holes in an abandoned airfield ? i ' d think a " free ukraine " handle would support confrontation with putin

which is why i separated him from any women on the show . not on the same day . couldn ' t agree with dan more matt it ' s embarrassing on so many levels you choose to promote him i respect your opinion joe as i do dan ' s . i also respectfully disagree . fair enough . . im aware he ' s entertaining and awful at poker but it ' s just not the type of image that promotes our game in a healthy light many said the same thing about dentale . i think that whole endeavor turned out to be a net positive for poker . hoping this one does also . i didn ' t compare them . i compared what people were saying to me about them both being on the show . everyone needs to relax .

what color is the skin creme ? white . a pure looking skin creme the color of coconut oil 🙂 coconut oil does not keep things white and pure , so that statement would be misleading . it keeps things moisturized , not white . the product in ad is anti - perspirant with " white mark protection " , for black and white clothing . so much experience being discriminated against , we know what it looks like most of the time . n everyone always denies when brought to light but it can turn also into paranoia when seeing racism into everything even a " product " slogan about a creme that ' s white i could notice a black power ad pretty easy too . noticing and portraying these images is ingrained in my profession . but we ' ve become a very all - embracing society in the u.s. no matter what some racists say to try and encourage divide . unfortunately , that ' s not true . come to texas . hate is projected by a feeling of inferiority intellectually , physically or otherwise and such folks will always find something to hate
if the president of the united states wants to bomb syria he is obligated to allow refugees in . .
this thread an excellent example of hazards of twitter . simon is not rehabilitating hitler , but single tweet rted creates false inferences … possessing sarin gas , hitler wouldn ' t use it on soldiers even as his reich fell . he ' d been gassed in wwi . assad has used it 2 x on civilians . but this is author fault for not documenting it ' s part of a thread . he doesn ' t give number where tweet falls into argument i often forget to number . i think before you rt an outrage , you must read the thread . the numbers show it ' s a thread or elipses do . it had neither . that ' s the author ' s responsibility

- twitter was so lit , twitter jail , real trending topics , being able to change your friends tweet , now y ' all just cry about nothing ! ! !
so , about halfway through with reasons why , and honestly i feel like this show is gonna do more harm than it is good i feel you on this i just feel like it romanticizes suicide and gives off the message that if you end your life people will finally care / give you attention like yes it gives some good awareness , but it ' s also extremely triggering and graphic and it just gives me a bad vibe yes . i def see how it speaks to the notion that you never know what someone is going through and its we need to be aware of how we treat - - others , but portraying this . . . almost revenge suicide and pinning reasons on specific people , it ' s a tricky / potentially dangerous thing .
take a drink every time the word " presidential " appears in an article tomorrow .
few things are more dangerous than when bipartisan consensus starts to emerge urging a new war . they trust trump to do this ? amazing .

syria gassed their own civilians , and we bombed what was practically an airbase . like , what else are we suppose to do ? there were no civilian casualties that i ’ m aware of ? so , i don ’ t know i guess i just don ’ t get why people are immediately up in arms . but with that said , i don ’ t understand anything about global politics . another caveat : the thought of the us putting boots on the ground does worry me .
hey - americans didn ' t vote for you to intensify hillary ' s disastrous foreign policy . … here ' s the video . she makes clear she thought obama should have done this before ( long known ) & that today ' s bombing is just & right : …
this seemed like a very different donald trump . more serious - - and clearly moved emotionally . frequently invoked the almighty . fuck you and trump both and fuck both your invocations of the almighty

guest after guest is gushing . from msnbc to cnn , trump is receiving his best night of press so far . and all he had to do was start a war . no war has been started so stop the lie
sure , but why not in ? not a contest , but the scale was . . . so much greater … i ' m curious what ' s changed . like this was clearly a strongly held conviction on his part . how ' d it dissipate so quickly ? either trump had a moral epiphany or he isn ' t consistent 🤔 i discount moral epiphany . so , inconsistent . but why ? simply erratic ? or is there an angle ? angles ?

interesting how blaire is using science to legitimize the transgender experience further , yet is accused of trying to invalidating it the only reason she ' s receiving backlash is because of stigma surrounding mental disorders the literal definition of a mental disorder is : blaire is using science to find a link between biology and transgenderism to suggest it isn ' t merely a choice but an innate entity when behavior that deviates from the norm has a biological base , there is no justification for discrimination , people respect science i was under the impression that the lgbt community was fighting for this kind of recognition , but transtrenders have changed this plz send your discourse here …

there ' s no evidence of those rebels having ever used chemical weapons or having the means for prduction . there ' s evidence assad has them . and anyway , the bombing of the hospitals after the chemical attack is evidence enough of assad ' s intention to kill rebellious civilians . to bomb hospitals is a war crime and by itself reason enough for a strike against the syrian airforce . period . if the intent was to kill kids , yes . if isis had used that school , no . some colateral casualties are unavoidable when fighting terrorists . compared w / previous wars , civilian casualties are a very low number . precision bombs make a difference . intelligence is the problem . what are you on about ? i simply stated the fact that there have been civilian casualties in all previous wars . what ' s your point ?

anyone know any airbnb hosts in japan ? yes , many in kyoto . i can introduce you on fb that ' d be nice ! i want to know about what it ' s like being a host , not lookin for a place to stay . i can connect you with them . but easy paraphrase from kyoto airbnb : bad tourists steal things . good tourists get lost . . . somehow . any comments on the grey zone in terms of legality of airbnb in japan ? people hosting legally ? most of the people i know are in the grey zone and operating under the table . i know kyoto laws are strict but none of them have been closed doh . hope the led change to make it legal . . . there has been a positive move towards lightening the rules ( like strict fire code rules against 押入れ )

someone just give me a japanese text patch , so i can completely ignore this garbage plaguing the english release from what i know persona had some very , very liberal translation and odd wording but it was never hugely erroneous like p5 it ' s been forever since i ' ve last played , so my memory on it is super hazy , but yeah . i don ' t ever remember it being near as bad as here which just makes me feel like i ' m reading bad fansubs from a decade ago though admittedly , i ' d probably be far less frustrated if we weren ' t talking about like " major game company ' s biggest release in the past half - decade . like i ' ve seen occasional comparisons with that sao game and not being as bad as it . which , while true , even with as big as sao is , i can ' t imagine it comes close to the modern persona games ' consumer base so comparing the two outside of being games with similar flavorings ( anime - ( esque ) ) just feels really misguided to me i ' d recommend never going back to p4 because those rose - tinted glasses won ' t protect you from anything whatsoever . the acting is poor , the dialogue feels like it ' s disjointed from character to character at parts , and the themes are , uh , little sus .
my statement on the us missile attack on a syrian government air base . where do we house them then ? how do we provide them with services when the the elderly and vulnerable are forgotten ?

us pundits love to talk war . the atmosphere right now in the media is one of celebration . syria . guess what ? the us has been bombing the hell out of syria ' s infrastructure and providing for the rebels . but this is different . this is not some covert action . this is showmanship . batman vs superman . cartoonish . people don ' t die in cartoons . so now trump and assad have gone mano a mano , shedding proxies & covert actions . the us elite is elated . the people are forgotten .

" we need smart diplomacy " ( says a former obama *deputy* secretary of state ) . where does the ny times get these people ? 😖 - vj syria strikes responding to your pic - - no , the idea is not that trump is a russian pawn . it ' s that russia wanted him elected to destabilize us and nato . not according to the cia , the fbi and the nsa , who all say putin never for one minute believed trump would win . it was about hillary . - vj actually , here is the director of the fbi explicitly referring to the assessment of the intelligence community . … russia thought trump had a shot , and if he loses , they ' ve undermined clinton . goal is western instability , not a trump under perfect control . samuel , that is absolutely false . the goal was to weaken hillary ' s administration and her authority . all intel agencies agree . - vj literally , comey : " no , the assessment of the intelligence community was that early on [ russia ] thought he might have a shot . " did u watch ?

til if you don ' t know a language properly , do not use it for formal communications . huh ? tarun vijay . either he was blatantly racist or his bad english screwed him up . the latter , i would believe don ' t really care about that . what is pissing me off is his denial of racism in a country with million dollar fairness cream industry . use precise terms . fairness creams are pushed by relatives . how many indian relatives belong to different races ? ? indians are an endogamous bunch . fairness creams are a result of inferiority complex of ones ' own skin color . then call it inferiority complex . why even call it racism ? why the eff would anyone like the demean the issue of race by making it , see the irony here , into a monochromatic one about complexion changing creams . fairness creams are part of the problem , not the problem . i don ' t mean to oversimplify anything . but yea , we racist af .

he went lateral to the straight line to his mark . learn the rules even if it ' s play on , he starts being tackled before the umpire calls it . which is a metre penalty . as soon as the umpire raises his hands ( which he did ) , it is deemed play on . adams never encroached the mark . not true , his arms are around zak before the initial hands in the air from the umpire . he was behind / on his mark . at no time did he step over it , or receive a warning from the umpire that he did . my point is the umpire was incorrect though . if a player has a mark can you tackle him before hearing the phrase ' play on ' ? umpire was correct and umpires dept . will confirm that . at no time did his body cross the mark and have umpire warn him to get behind it . please , the umpires dept always come out in support of bad calls . why can ' t you answer my question . can you tackle a player before ' play on ' he was tackled only when he went lateral to his mark . that is play on . play on is only play on once the umpire calls it though . zak can ' t react because he ' s tackled before the call .

yea man . the majority republican legislature that spent - million on bogus benghazi investigations an probes that turned up nothing dems and reps seem like extensions of the same body . . . so to dislike the dems is to feel the same about reps . our gov is corrupt . everything voters hated about hillary topped with scientific illiteracy , intellectual incuriosity , and racist steve bannon at the helm . first and foremost , there ' s no perfect science that validates climate change , once known as global warming and global cooling . . ! it will effect the world and national security domestic and internationally . there is no way around it . . . mind most of the " scientists " back whatever data is necessary in order to maintain their gov grant monies . so no , i don ' t buy it at all . in the scientific community . i ' ve seen the primary source studies . critical thinking will tell you we need a much larger sample before assessing anything as scientific fact . c ' mon now . i know you smart . . ! it went along with one of the several mass extinctions that the earth has experienced . we ' re talking about the same earth that had an ice age and before that the earth was completely green with no polar ice caps . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
sort of expected from white , but mayne is yet to demonstrate the club ' s faith in him . seems to lack confidence . trick is how long do u give him . maybe we need go smaller up fwd . grundy needs help , ran himself into the ground . disposals ruckman hit outs . awesome . but yes another tall . benny reid fwd leaves backline even more vulnerable . we need to build from the back , which we are . reid is too important we don ' t have many as efficient down back as reid using the ball too . we have the forward talent on our list . most of them are still young though mccarthy hopefully in due course will be one for future . mclarty will be the best of them but will probably be reid ' s replacement at chb . both of them are players i have in mind . but still would be handy to pick up a taller mature fwd . need the maturity / experience . young guys will be same as moore . but who ' s available ? elliott next week . wells the week after . crocker and cox can push for games too

wtf ! bicycle directions on google maps doesn ' t exist anymore ? ? i ' m livid ! no lie , that ' s the only way i ' m able to get to places i don ' t know so it ' s not gone , there ' s just a button to call an uber there , it pushed the bicycle button off the edge of the screen and it doesn ' t scroll unless you scroll it while it ' s still loading . i say , seize the means here . take goog ' s data , operate it as a public service . this ad for uber is getting in the way of accessibilty . bcs i don ' t drive , at all , for a reason . other people have even more obvious disabilities . the google maps app on my phone still offers bicycle directions fwiw no idea , i would never use an unlicensed taxi

there ' s always the fear i get every single stream that no one will return . 😔 or you have been forgotten after a hiatus . oh well 😓 never underestimate your audience ' s appreciation of you , ugr . i as a small streamer have enjoyed a warm welcome after being gone for weeks well you do make your audience moist dood <tong> haha , are you saying i ' m cheating ? 😆 maybe . . . . hey yurlyn when ' s your birthday ?
this is also an important demo of why it ' s important to maintain market price signals for non - dispatchable renewables . … demand curves slope downward . … the market can send all the signals it wants , but if you ' re on a feed in tariff or other fixed price , even builders of new gen don ' t care . with policies like a production tax credit or rec market , firms still lose revenue if they are generating during low price hours . they care , but at mc and say rec / ptc they only care enough to stop generating at - . matters for entry decision , not production .

so it ' s fine for trump & crew to have possible connections & leaks & deals , because hrc had an unsecured server . are you a russian shill ? lets hear what susan rice says under oath if she doesn ' t plead the 5 th - she has a history of being untruthful - benghazi video . and there it is . the rice story . that clinches it for me bc it ' s been proven she did her legal job . you ' re nothing but a russian shill . yea there it is can ' t call me a racist so new one us russian shill - pathetic sorry i hurt your feelings and invaded your safespace . but facts are facts . hrc found ng , rice did her job trump & co are under investigatn i gave you actual proof from our govt and news sources backed with video - you gave nothing but regurgitating left narratives w / o back up 👌 i won ' t fall for it . i check a lot of sources . just because i don ' t agree or fall for your bullmess you get all upset and angry . i ' m laughing my ass off - you are so predictable - you are too . keep defending russia . and i ' m sorry i invaded your safespace . how an i defending russia ? i said if they prove wrong doing they should go . prove is the key word - u with no evidence guilty

ex - uk ambassador : assad wasn ' t behind the chemical attack @ cnn : us launched a military strike on syrian govt target in retaliation for their chemical weapon attack on civilians earlier in the week trump : russia is sending a fleet of ships to the mediterranean . obama ’ s war in syria has the potential to widen into a worldwide conflict . how can we show our appreciation to mainstream media ?

related to a convo i had : do you prefer romance content in a bioware game to be specific representation ( e . g . gay ) or available to any char ? if you ' re not gonna put in the time , just make everyone playersexual . inadequate but at least you let players impose their vision on top if you are going to put in the time : you need to deemphasize straight ships . they are not lacking in rep . they should be last priority " specific representation " needs encompass more . queers stick together . having ships as " the gay one , the bi etc " is bad and not real life if me is far future of our world where majority us teens identify as " not - straight , " queer ppl should b everywhere , straightness uncommon successful " specific rep " would mean multiple portrayals of variance within identities . also , bi rep acknowledging queerness in fxm ships

these altgov types are trying to decide for everyone . they are not elected they are wannbe dictators . that ' s laughable . trump is the only wannabe dictator around . they are free people with their own opinions , just like you and i . oh really ? so tell me which of these points do you disagree with ? … i don ' t know . . . every single one ? are you against a sound middle class ? of course not , but in what manner ? so you ' re for the nazi party agenda ? you said trump was a dictator . hitler was more on the left than the right . plus / the american left taught hitler how to justify mass murder they thought they has the right to decide for everyone i had no knowledge of that . horrifying but doesn ' t change the situation with trump . my point is that no one has the right to decide for everyone in a democracy except those duly and lawfully elected . /

my thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the victims and families who ’ ve been affected by this horrific attack in sweden .
have to be careful with terms here . was a barbaric , brutal attack on sikhs . it was a pogrom . not a genocide . genocide is a different scale genocides generally involve millions of people dying due to various measures imposed generally by an invading power or by the govt . ridiculous . here is what the genocide convention says . targeted killings of a religious / ethnic group is the very definition of genocide . yes i agree with this definition . do you believe the intent was the wipe off all sikhs ? or a large part of sikhs ? if yes then it was genocide yes it was . sikhs were killed all over india , lists of addresses provided . add fake encounters , disappearances too so if you include and what happened in the following years then yes it cud be seen as a genocide .

it ' s not the past , it ' s very much our present ! we don ' t need the scummy sun or mail . they couldn ' t have cared less for our interests devils advocate , in both positions sun supported britain over europe / eu . it ' s also brought gib a lot of support in uk so soak it up . true , sensationalist headlines are one thing , but ridiculous antics at our expense that achieve nothing are not acceptable media is , i accept , far too powerful these days . however this is pushing gibraltar into the headlines on all formats . it ' s a positive . the risks are : oversimplification ( that it ' s about sovereignty rather than gibraltar within the eu / uk deal ) and / . . . sensational headlines risk alienating people in uk who don ' t like the sun ' s war mongering & they start having sympathy for spain / that ' s certainly true mark , but the sovereignty issue will inevitably get tangled up and that ' s when the big problem will start .

well , if you ' re going to ignore the actual research on this in favor of " rub some dirt on it , like everyone had to years ago , " enjoy . … playing professional sports also increases injury risk . taking charges , setting screens , and boxing out defenders increases risk as well we should ask doctors if they recommend not playing professional sports in order to avoid knee injuries . i think you are on to something ! good talk , man . have a great day . you too . sorry i got emotional . but i get frustrated with that line of thinking andrew , if you ran the cavs would you rec lebron play min a night for games ? if thats the only other option , then no it ' s obviously absurd . and it indicates you agree that resting players is good and necessary . so why is it unreasonable to extrapolate . . .

bottom line is trump managed to enforce a " red line " in syria - - the exact one obama ran away from . big win for trump there , can ' t deny . / obama didn ' t quite " run away " from the red line . congress refused to support him . no differences in scenarios here . except rs hold congress . this is exactly what i thought too . not sure how that makes obama weak . trump acted without congressional approval , why couldn ' t obama ? because it ' s not a good use of executive privilege . the executive is way too powerful right now . and syria is not an easy fix . there is a power vacuum there . once al asad is out , who is ready to assume power ? isis ? russia ? we don ' t know .

( ) if he was interested in degrading syria ' s air force , he wouldn ' t have given putin advance notice . putin then gave assad advance notice . ( ) the result of giving both russia and syria advance notice of the air strike was that they moved their troops and bunkered their planes . ( ) one indication putin knew the strike would be no threat to him or syria is russian air defenses didn ' t try to take down _any_ tomahawks . ( ) if trump was interested in degrading syria ' s flight capability in homs , he wouldn ' t have left an air strip _untouched_ . but he did that . ( ) gop congressmen and retired generals were saying this air strike would be ineffective . which is why trump consulted putin , but not them . ( ) in , trump saw the same pictures of chemical - weapon devastation and opposed air strikes . so his " conversion narrative " is a _farce_ . ( ) the strikes successfully pushed russiagate coverage off the front page . we were talking about nunes and kushner scandals , now we ' re not . ( ) incredibly — bizarrely — trump somehow struck syria with _59 tomahawk missiles_ without articulating even a _single_ coherent strategic aim . ( ) for all the talk of trump ' s syrian about - face , he ' s no more committed to ousting assad than a week ago , when he expressed no interest . ( bonus ) trump and putin can now look like they ' re at odds — helpful for russiagate — when in fact trump ' s ineffective strike didn ' t harm putin .

timing makes it tougher , but i really hope some fresh candidates get a look in edmonton . brock sunderland has an obvious connection . cfl the window interview candidates on other cfl teams has closed . no looks for new kids . if my assistant gm comes to me and says , “ i ’ m really interested in that opportunity , ” i ’ m letting him interview . is cfl going to say no ? it ' s - weeks before mini - camp , a month before draft , less than months before tc . teams won ' t put themselves behind - ball to help a rival . the only team behind the - ball will be the esks . there are gm jobs . the cfl is too small for that crap . you ' re asking other teams to suffer the consequences of the esks mismanagement . the window exists for a reason . hey , if teams say “ no , you can ’ t talk to my guy , ” so be it . i bet most gms would allow it because it ’ s fairly rare .
speaking of " village of the damned " , in my day we instinctually knew children were terrifying . we didn ' t honor them , we had them exorcised . creepy children are legit the most horrifying movie monsters that aren ' t clowns . or ventriloquist puppets *shudder* dolls also . so in conclusion the most terrifying monster would be a child with a clown puppet . * sobs quietly * thanks . now i have to see a mental health professional . i am sorry for this : why would you ever make such a thing ? imagine it going off at three in the morning . and it would ! there are videos of the doll on low batteries . it sounds like it came straight from hell . and since my batteries are always low , i ' ll get my money ' s worth . you should program a laughter app . like elevator music in hell .

most everyone i know that loves rural life values privacy and freedom to act over being connected all the time . it ' s a trade , but also > … do you think there ’ s an impact on rural preference now with internet ? there ' s a lot of people who just feel healthier living in nature than in concrete . i think city people must need people like i like trees . but i ' m hugely social and i love the internet because it gives me so many people to be friends with , just also i ' m still in pajamas . then a lot of people are just from here , and it ' s home . i figure people who feel the best in any other setting must have similar reasons . it ' s the thing i don ' t understand about the argument that people should just all move . for a lot of folks , living where they live is best . like , the answer to rural poverty isn ' t to move everyone to the cities and keep paying farmers for shit unless they ' re industrial . it ' s figure out in this world of tech where i ' m talking to people all over the world for free basically how to get jobs out here . bring back as much manufacturing as possible for sure . make multinationals invest in the place . but also maybe update trade schools . and community colleges . a lot of the utility of " talking to anyone in the world for free " is unlocked with lib - arts education . . .

if that pisses you off , wait until you read article . founders always intended taxes to be levied the application of the 1 6 th has been a continual violation of article , section , para . if you read the federalist papers , the founders appears intended individual taxes . the 1 6 th was clarification after anti americans sued the individuals who sued were discovered to be trying to abolish the federal government entirely , they never had a constitutional basis and those continuing to attack what ' s specified in a1s8 and the 1 4 th are just as anti america today . and finally , even if your insane position was correct on a1s8 , you ignore what an amendment is . the 1 6 th by definition overrules no , it doesn ' t . particularly when it ' s application violates various other civil rights outlined in the 4 th , 5 th , 1 4 th and a1s8 . except it does none of that , and later armaments always take precedence . that ' s how amendments work that is nonsense . one amendment cannot cancel another . to modify one , the process must be used to modify that one .

i don ' t trust trump and doubt his strike will do much good . but i ' m amazed how many people think he ' s incapable of sincerity or good intent . why would military action cause you to be amazed at that ? couldn ' t muslim ban , deportations , gorsuch appt etc have been " sincere " ? i ' m disputing the idea that he did this for polls . his sincerity here is on a par with his sincerity re muslim ban . " bad guys , do something " sincerity is overrated . you can be sincere and misguided , sincere and rash , sincere and destructive . but it ' s still real . i guess i ' m wondering why wonder about possibility of sincerity now ? what is it abt bombing that spurs that question ?
trying not to be paranoid , but if putin staged an event to make trump seem presidential and un - puppety wouldn ’ t it look a lot like this ? seriously ! you think the murder of innocent civilians ( many children ) with sarin gas was a ' staged event ' by putin ! ! ! ! come on clark . behave you don ' t touch sarin gas victims with bare hands like white helmets did . so either staged , or not sarin . most likely the latter could be chlorine , but i ' m not sure how you can mix up these two , since one has no smell at all and the other has quite a distinctive smell sarin or chlorine . it ' s still a chemical weapon and assad needs to pay for his war crimes .

proudly supports arts enthusiasts to celebrate nigerian poets who use poetry to unite their countrymen spoken words poetry there has never been a time nigeria has been in unity . have you not seen or heard of army & police brute force on civilians ? it ' s sad . our values are so cocked up . the previous generations of intellectuals must be ashamed & turning in their graves . yoruba poets promote their nation , igbo the same , tiv the same and so on . movie industry also turning same nigeria ' s problem is not cos we are diverse , it ' s cos we ' ve been taught to believe we can ' t all coexist . it ' s a mental barrier we can ' t pass nigeria is irreconcilable . write it down ! u will reach old age and nigeria be going step forward backwards and why is that ? because we lack the ability to rise above our sentiments & forge a better country or because we believe we cant ? it is not becus of sentiment , it is because there is no basis for unity . nig is just a geographical expression take igbo nation for example . before colonization dey were scattered into tribes that fought among demselves over land & other provocations but there is a basis for unity ! thanks because you have come to my point . they speak one language , one culture

lol you ’ re saying this like it ’ s some nba rule or something . like everything has to follow the status quo you ’ re listing out . just look at the latest mvp winners . at least in a third position . yes , i ’ m aware he ’ d be the first mvp below third since . also not as relevant considering what he ’ s doing this season . look oscar robertson . he did not win it . he stayed in third position . yes , i ’ m aware . that was also back when players voted and bill russell was the man . times have changed , and this is a different mvp race . for that very reason , times have changed and the mvp only go for the players of a third position . look curry when he won it . that makes zero sense and has zero relation to why curry won in . look at this man . the wins count much more than the statistics for the mvp a ) that isn ’ t true b) this is one mvp race and c ) people forget how many 4 th quarters curry sat out that year . that is not true 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 . look at all the mvps and you can see that victories count more

is this a swedish thing or do others get this , too ? today was the 2 nd time i got that question from an autistic person . actually autistic … when someone says " can ' t we reclaim the puzzle piece ? " actually autistic i don ' t believe i ' ve ever heard that idea before . i also don ' t understand why someone would even want to do that in the first place . i really don ' t know . but a lot of autistic ppl in sweden are stuck in a medical / charity perspective . and the orgs have the pp as a symbol . we ' re way behind when it comes to neurodiversity and autistic activism . i ' m sure our lack of language when talking about ableist oppression plays a part , but i don ' t think it explains everything i learned a lot from reading blogs in english and i guess some aren ' t able to do that , or haven ' t found them . i really think we should write more in swedish about this to develop better tools . also i would like to translate some texts . yeah . i ' m just way better at communicating in english than i ' m in swedish & i know it hurts matters like these <annoyed> i ' m curious : do most people in sweden know both swedish and english or no ?

a thread for nagai kei , my best boi ™ of the year what do we know about nagai kei ? do we understand him ? how could we claim we know him if he doesn ' t know himself ? we kept scratching at the surface of nagai kei ' s character until eventually , we saw enough of his demons to feel satisfied he ' s not a trope . he isn ' t some whack redundant protagonist , and he is not run off the mill either his emotionally detached pragmatism , packed up in a thin layer of sarcasm , made it hard to catch sight of his strong moral values at first but nagai kei is the same boy who put hard work into becoming a doctor to save lives because he knows the value of each human being

i agree with the syria strike . this is a measured response to syria ' s deed - not a war . we needed to show we can & will react to an atrocity yeah , because it was sure in doubt whether the us govt would bomb or invade a sovereign nation on sketchy pretenses . . best analogy is reagan ' s one - off strike vs khadafi in . khadafi was out of control ; strike had desired effect of forcing him back in line not really , given that it ' s far from settled that assad was behind the chem attacks . again , was the us attacked ? the intel on assad likely goes far beyond what you or i know . you can ' t be so certain with your assumption of recklessness by the us here true - not like our govt has ever proven worthy of skepticism or used flimsy rationale to make war . we should probably just trust them . .

happy flashback friday from the quartermaines circa ! fbf gh
only now any majority party in congress will be able to have absolute say in whoever is given a seat in the future . republicans almost always voted for a democratic president ' s choice for scotus . so basically the playing field will now be even . not so . now nobody can stop the majority rule . i mean , why call it a republic if we ' re just working on majority rule ? further , history shows you should have talked with senator reid when he started changing things for dems . would have loved to . but let ' s be real linda , revenge politics have never made anything better . how will that help the american people ? it was definitely a short sighted victory for gop . lol 😂 just wait till potus selects the next - scotuss in his - yr administration dems screwed themselves 😂 blame russia out of touch you really shouldn ' t cheer for the deaths of seated scotus members . . . umm . . . no deaths ginsburg will retire soon ( or never wake up from napping on job ) & thomas indicated retirement okay mayb death 🙌 🎉 🕺 🏼 that ' s some dark , cold thinking .
such need to have an adventure ; the thought was adorable and attractive , bringing a smile to her light features before lusicious lips — — would part to let out a small gasp at the next tug , remaining smile as the half and half scanned the area ; yaoyorozu biting her lip —
it ' s hilarious when people get so embarrassed that they get upset to mask their insecurity . like this lady who walked into the bar today .
a big moral issue on my mind is right now " react as a guy and it seems you love her but don ' t like it you may seems gay " just guy things
it looks like was the beyonce of after all : this record shows he is a sell out & let his " team " make decision for him . the song is boring & depressing . waiting to see what liam has .

the comment section is interesting . . . but can ' t straight hair be a style . . . just like braids . . . conrows . . . . and bantu knots . . . . . . . … do you agree ? whoopi goldberg says wearing weave is cultural appropriation more than one ethnicity has straight / fine hair . . . .

wouldn ' t it be nice if it was impossible to suspect putin ok ' d assad ' s gas attack so trump could fire missiles & change the subject in usa ?
just received this fan letter . i don ' t know which book she read . and i don ' t think i ' ve even referred to philidelphia , but , uh , okay . . .
what if j . cole someday has an idea for a great feature ? are we putting too much pressure on him to stay feature - free ? i worry about things . now this kinda sounds like you
i feel like i ' m losing my goddamn mind , but this whole syria business leaves a bad taste in my mouth . on the surface , it ' s a stupid decision with little tactical gain that will only serve to create more violence . but more than that , i fear that trump only did this to make people think he ' s not buddy - buddy with russia .
tomi lahren is suing former boss glenn beck for wrongful termination gets her feelings hurt and then sues . who are the snowflakes ? lol . i don ' t agree with tammy on anything really , but damn , she got fired because she ' s pro choice ? that ' s bs and has every right to sue . wrongful termination means someone fired of a protected class . the snowflake irony is rich but unless it was gender specific she ' ll lose . true , she wasn ' t discrimnated in any way but i don ' t even expect it to go to court . she might end up getting a nice settlement out of it . that ' s my guess too . sad for her that she hasn ' t latched on somewhere else . law suit seems desperate .
already i ' m seeing . i can ' t imagine why assad would do it , so . . . . he can ' t have done it , so . . . . a response is unjustified .
a rather monstrous peacock slipped onto the hotel how gorgeous it looks though . maybe it ' s asking for someone to scan its skeletons - an annual check - up ! 😉 health tourism radiologist at work hahahaha too many panoramic pictures

by the fucking way we been bombing the tits off of syria forever . are you just now hearing of it ? oh shit media actually did some reporting 😱 just syria ? 😉
people seem to have a lot of feelings about this article . which seems to be a interesting trend . thoughts ? … many many many many thoughts . share any ? so curious ! . my kink / fetish isn ' t about a choice in sexual practise - i resent the articles impaction and simplification of my identity . i kinda think all sexual identities are about choice , but thats not about kink vs queer . hard to phrase - but i disagree based only on my own experiences . i ' m gonna say a think i haven ' t full thought through , so don ' t hold me to it , but i don ' t actually think kink is alternative . alternative to what ? the norm i think - like everything - it ' s a spectrum .
i don ' t play the game , but my understanding is that most people lie with higher frequency when they play golf . … trump has made false claims in days . on two of three days he did not make false claims , he played golf . …

although now someone will write a story about how white people are identity - less & this is how they start culturally appropriating everyone about ten years ago is the first time i heard white people talking about how they were identity - less & it boggled me + because i grew up with an immigrant mother & a strong ethnic identity . but + it also made me realize why some aspects of mainstream us culture felt so odd to me + while at the same time i clearly benefit ( ed ) from white privilege . anyway , identity - less is such a weird phrase to me for me it ' s about your power being so pervasive you don ' t realize you have it ( since it ' s everywhere ) yes . agree . i even wrote a blog post about it a few years ago . yet the discussion never ends .
hey dev twitter , i have a question i never know just the right answer to and i ’ d like some feedback : is it cool to explicitly state you are looking to find underrepresented - in - tech folks for panels / speaking etc ? i don ’ t want to feel like i am tokenizing anyone , so i try mostly to go through my network and be good to orgs that focus on this . but i feel like i could be more effective in my diversity - oriented endeavors if i were less gingerly about it . as a white - dude - in - tech , i try hard to get this right and don ’ t want to be the arbiter of right - and - wrong on this issue . sometimes , like with our she coded campaign with , identity - based outreach is more clearly acceptable . but sometimes i ’ m not sure , so any feedback is really appreciated . i think it ' s okay . i wouldn ' t approach a speaker saying , " hey , you ' re diverse , wanna speak ? " though . <happy>
there has to be redemption . anyone who serves their time deserves a chance . fair play to gary for turning his life around . late late show is gary glitter on the late late then ? ah here ! a man named gary cunningham , jailed for possession with intent to supply . seems a thoroughly likable fellow . my notion didn ' t seem terribly likely . still , you never know . in fairness , that *would* be a hell of a late late show . can ' t imagine i ' d post a similar tweet , though . . .

explain the " absolute value " you think humans have with the existence of god ? what difference does it make if we just evolved by accident ? … easy . if god doesn ' t exist , humans have no absolute value as we weren ' t created with intent . we are simply provide of time / chance / matter . " evolved by accident " you just eliminated meaning . if all are " evolutionary accident " nothing holds absolute value . no real reason . your concept of meaning is wildly skewed . meaning is held by a mind , if your life had no meaning to yourself that is your problem

maybe there ' s more reason to now . against obama was blind hate . now it ' s actually stuff that messes with people ' s lives . messing with whose life something tells me you ' re part of the hysteria problem people who will be affected by the things he plans to cut / enforce . i know i personally loved after school programs . people are always effected by something . this is nothing new to the presidency . when has a president decided to cut programs that were doing good just to pour more into an already huge defense fund ? can ' t states fund what they find important ? so you think these programs should come out of state taxes ? does that include programs done through schools that don ' t use school money i think if people really want these programs to exist , they ' ll find a way to make it work . i think my biggest issue with cutting the programs is that it was unnecessary to cut them . if they didn ' t work i ' d understand that . it ' s about funding . wot is , wot isn ' t necessary . i do think 2 day ' s kids may be coddled & r used things handed them . i cud be wrong ?

it ' s just a snapshot . even in a bad east , show me a star who made finals w / less scoring around him . even bron had larry hughes derrick rose made it to the conference finals . that offense was sorely underrated because we so badly wanted to convince ourselves rose was mvp when he wasn ' t their offensive rating was with rose off with a ts %. rose was the only player w / an above average ts % and ppg . to add to that last tweet , okc falls w / out wb , curry is , cp3 is , isaiah is , rose closer to pg13 ( ) and kawhi ( ) . but none of that has a lick to do with how good rose ' s offense was without him . if your argument is how much chi fell off without him kobe ' s drop was bigger ( ) , pierce ' s drop was way bigger ( ) + so was nash ( ) your argument was the offense was fine without him . what other teams did without their stars doesn ' t make that team better without rose . my argument was that he had talent around him , not that it was fine without him . i ' d rather have boozer deng korver etc than mckie and snow and again , i ' m not going to re - argue this whole dammed thing years later . leave it alone .

meaning besides the usa , what other countries have started attacking syria to show them their assault on their own was wrong ? so you are ok with kids getting killed by chemicals ? we are the only ones with the balls to stand up . screw it . let him kill their citizens . if they die . they die . no business of ours . right ? still waiting . if you want to debate i ' m here . you can ' t defend the point of not responding . let ' s just chill and let them kill each other take that shit somewhere else . stand up for folks that can ' t help themselves . too many convo ' s going on here . that reply towards me ? i hope not . i was just asking what other countries ? do you not feel like someone should defend the defenseless ? i do but at the cost of using our own military men and women lives ? trump is invested in this somehow like bush with hussein ' s fake war . oh ? so you don ' t think taking sadam out was a good thing ? he killed million of his own , innocent people . put your party away .

as a tech integration specialist in early years i enjoy witnessing how learning happens in varied ways with the little ones inz pir ed how do you think upper school teachers could benefit from knowing these ? inz pir ed in fact v design our programme of inquiry for the whole year keeping in mind the vertical progression across grades & disciplines in zpir ed that takes care of curriculum but what about teaching styles ? inz pir ed but in early years a great focus is on learning through play and observing emergent learning through free play inz pired which is something we lose out on as kids get older . by the way do you have cross phase observations at your school ? inz pir ed very sad but unfortunately true . what are cross phase observations ? inz pir ed

. world war reference is the dead giveaway . putin hates hillary , hence so do his bots . do the russians realize they made a deal with a conman ? , , trumo is pulling the ultimate con of all times , putin was conned just like us i think putin is the head conman and trump is the puppet / conman . putin has some shit on him and a deal in oil . either way for putin it was a great week , , stops the russian probe news , all of the sudden he goes from being orange money to mr . potus

we ' re very proud of our president donald trump , god bless him and give him strength and patience to fight all terrorists and spread peace fluffy , most of us disapprove of trump . i was totally embarrassed to watch him stand beside the king of jordan and make a fool of us again . trump and his supporters are battling a corrupt political class and the crony capitalists who support them . we ' re not the bad guys . i think you meant to say " employing crony capitalists " instead of " battling " crony capitalists are people who benefit from the expansion of the " administrative state " , that ' s why it ' s being deconstructed . it ' s the " administrative state " that builds roads , protects our food and water and fights crime . i support govt services that enhance our ability to voluntarily exchange what we rightfully own , and defends claims of rightful ownership . greed unfortunately is a major contributor to human suffering . we are , by nature , self serving laws are needed to protect the most vulnerable i think a little greed is healthy ; evolution favors aggression . i think taking things without content of the rightful owner , is bad . evolution favors species who form social groups . they protect one another and share learned skills .

overt & covert racism amongst indians is a real problem . thanks to our obsession with caucasian features carrying over from colonial days . its not just skin color that we obsess over , we aren ' t any nicer to very fair north east indians or asians than we are to dark skinned ppl . indians were shamed for their looks under colonial regime , the standard of beauty became caucasians . not just fairness , but body shape too and this obsession to pass off as caucasians in both skin color and body structure carries to this day … indians were shamed for their looks under colonial regime , the standard of beauty became caucasians . not just fairness , but body shape too institutionalized by " face whitening creams " and legitimized by bollywood . sheer number of songs starting with " gori " is an indicator . so deeply ingrained is this ridiculous beauty standard that most of the time we won ' t even realize we ' re being racists . nothing exposes your inherent biases like coming to a cosmopolitan , impossibly diverse city like nyc though . realization dawned slowly . still remember relatives who would " worry " about me since i was two shades darker than my brothers . thankfully parents never cared for it . it has a lot to do with media / movie interpretation of hero / heroine . i grew up watching dusky heroines , the idea of beauty was associated

i rarely agree with trump but al assad deserved what he got . he is a sick human being who has committed numerous atrocities to the innocent it ' s tough for me . morally i believe it ' s correct . but we attacked a sovereign nation against international law . it ' s iraq all over again . international law . it ' s gonna an interesting next few years . . .

just by the way trump announced the strikes with so much bluster , you can tell it ' s all a show . then all his cronies have posted their doubts in unison , all singing from same hymn sheet . it ' s laughably transparent .
as someone who struggled in the past with self harm and those thoughts . . . i ' m truly disappointed with how reasons why executed the show . yes , the show was entertaining . but had i watched this as a year old , it could ' ve been detrimental . i do not encourage anyone who has a past with depression , bullying , anxiety , etc to watch it . it ' s not worth it . just read the book . please . this just made my decision to not watch it . thank you .

j.k. rowling burns donald trump in magical tweets . . .
. thoughts about obama & trump ' s responses to assad ' s chemical weapons use . first , they both had the right impulses . cw use against civilians was intolerable and needed to be met with something , prob a strike . but obama went through the process the right way : asking congress , getting allies on board . they stonewalled him and then blamed him . . trump went about it the wrong way and was rewarded for it . he skipped congress and didn ' t consult allies . but then they all endorsed it . . where i put blame on obama is that he over - thought it and his proposed military response was too large to be popular . . he prob should have had the insight that sthing more limited , like this strike , would have gotten same response from allies and congress . but maybe it ' s also evidence of good behavior not being rewarded . why didn ' t congress & allies just say they ' d support something smaller . my lingering worry is that this just encourages trump to skip good process and norms , because it usually works out for him in the end

not one of them are a real problem , everything will get sorted in the end . trouble is most are about political opportunism . you don ' t think these things are a problem because they ' re not your problem , classic brexiteer attitude . they will be your problem soon . i think there are great number of people willing these matters to become a problem leave voters , the rest of us knew this would happen & voted accordingly . i voted for the freedom to make trade deals where and when we like - the eu is doomed , a protectionist , inward looking sluggish winging club in your dreams ! we have nations to trade with on our doorstep - along with all the other countries the eu has / is working on trade agreements with we will have the whole world in future we won ' t get as good a deal as the eu gets . stands to reason that if they give us a better desk they risk upsetting bigger customer base i ' d like it to work . . . i ' m terrified of what is ahead for this country : economically , socially , politically

( london & se ) . where was it ? unfortunately uk is the only country with no epp members . that does not diminish the fact they got the most meps in a democratic election . mrs may is the elected mp for maidenhead . please remind me which electorate voted for commissioner juncker . which euroconstituency ?

ace and aro people do not have to provide everyone a personalized education . follow us and learn . don ' t expect us to come to you with a gentle correction when you mess up . if you ' re being aphobic , even unintentionally , it is on you . not on the ace or aro person who did not correct you how you wanted them to . and if you do get called out for aphobia , treat it like you would getting called out for any other kind of - phobia . it is not any lesser . you are hurting real people . it matters . stop minimizing our pain . i see this constantly . the assumption that aphobia doesn ' t really matter . or matters less than other kinds of queerphobia . that entire idea is based on an aphobic assumption that treats aces and aros as less .
i get what you ' re getting at , but puppies , even purebred puppies of specific breeds , are available from shelters and rescues . especially breed - specific rescues . though it will typically be a longer wait and / or more looking , depending on how specific your desire is . yeah , it ' s much more difficult . my plan is to start monitoring craigslist for puppies free / so cheap i know no one ' s selling profesionally . yeah , that works , though there are definitely unscrupulous breeders selling there too . also , check vet offices ' boards ( the physical sort ) . i know . that ' s why i ' m talking like - per puppy . something where you literally can ' t be profitting . if you have your heart set on a specific breed , keep an eye on that breed ' s local rescue just in case . they get pregnant dogs sometimes . right . i personally love chows . i doubt i ' ll find something like that , but i will look ( i ' m moving before i get one ) . otherwise , craigslist . i ' m also not hard set on a chow , but i kinda want one ( i grew up with chows ) . big dogs are fun !

omniscience is cool . what does " mobilize isis " mean ? so , you don ' t think she would have used ice like obama had ? and , how do you know that , aside from your omniscience ?
so , at least according to , the " romance " lasted a grand total of days ? pretty disappointing kremlin infiltration , if true : … after the strike , russia ’ s romance with donald trump is dead you keep grasping at straws to avoid admitting that your friends in the kremlin wanted the worst candidate in history to win yes trump is putins puppet and that ' s why trump tried to have putins ally killed today lol only if " trump ' s ally " was one of the suckers who wasn ' t given the evacuation order at the base after trump gave putin hrs warning conspiracy theory much ? russia did defend this and is breaking relations over it , im not defending airstrikes , i thought they were careless

ritchie get games for punch and giordano gets nothing for destroying fowlers knee ! get your shit together u r a joke comparing apples and oranges . i agree gio should have gotten something but it ' s clear now the way the nhl views knees vs heads . ritchie being suspended is deserved . but giordano didnt even got a hearing for his bs play . . you are preaching to the choir . the nhl it seems just doesn ' t view kneeing as being sever . no kneeing suspension in years . i get your point . and the whole thing sucks . . yelp . cam is one of my favorite players . it was heartbreaking seeing him on the ice like that .

i used inspire from ur movies , but now i realised how lowlife nuisance are the actors . how dare u divide my maa bhaarati ! ? first comment abt tarun vijay he was the reason for the tweet misunderstood statement from tarun vijay makes u forget what he pitched for brothers in south , do google ' bout him . he equated us with africans didnt he now what do u mean by us here . besides this can ' t be a scapegoat others incite hatred amongst us , this is treason . the two big parties bjp congress already created hatred in us by their ruling as vote bank politics not for welfare of people what nuisance is this . is this the reason why is inciting hatred & treason against maa bhaarati . you think its a hatred then what about bjp created hatred in south especially andhra by fake promises and dividing ap in illegal way irrelevant , past events doesn ' t justify today ' s actions . it was telangana who demanded separation . then in up also there is demand for seperation wont u ever heard that ? 😂

so many comments that trump did what obama wouldn ’ t do . except trump bombed syria for violating the chemical - weapons ban obama negotiated . obama ' s treaty which actually achieved a goal instead of putting million potholes in a runway . a strike so effective they were bombing the same neighborhoods from the same airbase day later . what ban ? didn ' t syria just use them ? used in , russia deals to remove them , syria doesn ' t use them again til obama out of office and avowedly non interventionist trump in so many people have so little interest in history or current events . syria issues poorly understood often distorted and trump did it to try to distract . . to " prove " no collusion with russia . obama surrendered diplomacy and compliance on chemical weapons to russia to preserve his awful iran nuke deal . good job , all around . remember , before obama ’ s historic , game - changing ban , chemical weapons were okey - dokey . syria sarin assad …

still pissed that years ago there were some islands you didn ' t manage to steal but uk invaded the islands in , so years ago . argentina celebrates its independence day this year . no pierdas más el tiempo ! con este pelotudo estas hablando ! es que siento pena por ellos , repiten slogans porque no tienen estudios . sólo esquilan ovejas . 😂 👍 malvinista mythology is easy to refute . you just need minutes on google and a brain in your head . at least argentina has solid bases to defend sovereignty . anyhow it will be solved between two nations : uk and argentina . the curious thing is , you can have the islands any time . all you need is the consent of the people who live there . why is that so hard ? in un , arg & uk talks about interests , not desires or wishes . there is a big difference from the point of view of the international law . so take it to the icj . it ' s only about years since the first international court was founded . we ' re still waiting . we coincide . with good diplomacy , nations can solve this in the icj . allowing its jurisdiction .
not even the main actress 😪 i wonder what she did to get the role only few of the cast can actually act but are slept on 😪 names ? chyler is the only actress , i think the others only try to chyler > calista in s1 > chris > jeremy , thats it chris and jeremy . . nah . . and calista she was good yea they cant act but theres a big difference between both yet yea , funny how benoist isn ' t in this list i like her but her acting is kinda meh . . . she prolly would be after jeremy or something their acting is kinda similar ? after katie and many others

amos was best player vs walsall as well shouldn ' t have been subbed i just think sometimes he makes silly mistakes or bad decisions i rate amos and think he ' s done well whenever i ' ve seen him but he ' s no better than what we ' ve already got , currently anyway . i think southend seem to never have a quality passer like ryan woods when he was at shrewsbury and amos seems to be perfect for that all our passing is , is trying to hoof it up the pitch and hope for the best , he picks out some lovely balls down the line and one - twos exactly thats why he ' s perfect right ? yeah , shame he will definitely go back to tottenham should do everything to try and keep him and the brighton gk for next season wont happen certainly wouldn ' t rule it out if we were to be in the championship

he ' s a regular von clausewitz now . … the reason you don ' t generally hit runways is that they are easy and inexpensive to quickly fix ( fill in and top ) ! so much for not discussing your strategy , donnie it ' s okay now to do so now that the conflict has been resolved by his brilliant strategy .

wait a minute : anthony burch tried to analyze every single line in persona ? to be completely honest , i ' m actually surprised he would even attempt that in a shin megami tensei game . he ' s might so used to the actual , blatant stuff that happens in common sjw games that the underlying stuff in smt goes over his head . and if you seriously tried to analyze every single line in any smt game , your mind would explode as if it was reading the necronomicon .
what happened ? " god loves me but hates my sin " yeah , that idea is gaaaaaaaarrrrrbaaaaageeeeeeeeeee well a person who is my friend said it , so i guess it ' s true . because i am so afraid of losing everyone , i ' d rather die than lose a friend . your friend is wrong . and this is not worth dying for . they need to change their opinion , because they are wrong . but she wont . she is a bad friend . bu arent i a bad person if i dont want to be her friend anymore just because of her beliefs ? no . her beliefs hurt you directly , and no - one deserves to be hurt . arent i hurting her feelings ?
i ' m happy with the switch lineup right now , and it ' ll only get better … looking for more games to play ? has - been heroes , snake pass and human resource machine are all worth a look . having comes on the go is key for me . instantly adds value because it ' s easier to skip over these games on another platform

true . though , as i ' ve said elsewhere , rapidly growing cities like brampton & mississauga *always* had less media than thunder bay . so - … ryerson research : canada has lost local newspapers since and large communities like mississauga have less media than thunder bay . so it ' s about time cities twice the size of thunder bay , london and kingston had media coverage . most toronto news is irrelevant to .

don ' t mind me . i ' m just bored over here at work . 😂
