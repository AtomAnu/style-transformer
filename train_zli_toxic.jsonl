We must move back to a nation where our political system is based on one person, one vote. @SenSanders Based on my conversation with Judge Gorsuch and a review of his record, do I believe he’ll vote to overturn Citizens United? Absolutely not. @SenSanders Second—it’s not too much to ask that all people eligible to vote should be able to vote without harassment, roadblocks and barriers. @SenSanders We have one of lowest voter turnout rates. We should be encouraging people to participate in politics, not making it harder for them. @SenSanders There is nothing I've seen or heard from Judge Gorsuch to make me believe he is prepared to overturn the gutting of the Voting Rights Act. @SenSanders I also believe there's a strong likelihood Judge Gorsuch would vote to overturn Roe v Wade, denying women the right to control their bodies @SenSanders We need a Supreme Court justice who will protect workers’ rights, not just corporate profits. I fear Judge Gorsuch is not that person.", "label": 1, "init_label": 1}
